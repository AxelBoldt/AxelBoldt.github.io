<h1>Linux Kernel Configuration Help Texts</h1>

Here is the combined wisdom of the net regarding the configuration
options of the Linux kernel. Thanks to all who have
contributed!<p>

These help texts should give useful information for the configuration
of Linux kernel versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, and 2.1.<p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="Configure.help-1.2">Help texts for kernels 1.2.x</a>
  <li><a href="Configure.help-1.3">Help texts for kernels 1.3.x</a>
  <li><a href="Configure.help-2.0">Help texts for kernels 2.0.x</a> 
  <li><a href="Configure.help-2.1">Help texts for kernels 2.1.x</a> 
  <li><a href="Configure.help-2.2">Help texts for kernels 2.2.x</a> 
</ul>

Please
 tell me about any mistakes you spot or any suggestions or
improvements you have. My email address is <a href="mailto:axelboldt@yahoo.com">axelboldt@yahoo.com</a>.<p>

If you are new to Linux and anything in the help texts is unclear to you,
please let me know. This thing is for you.
<p>

Feel free to use these help texts for your own configuration tools.  I
have written a rather primitive drop-in replacements for the standard
configuration script <code>Configure</code> which uses these help texts during the "make
config" stage. Since the
configuration process and the directory layout has slightly changed
under 1.3, there are now two versions of the help texts and
configuration scripts:

<h3>Installing the new Configure script for kernel versions 1.2.x</h2>

To install the new configuration script and the help texts, first
rename the old script:
<pre>mv /usr/src/linux/Configure /usr/src/linux/Configure.old</pre>
then download the new one from <a
href="Configure-1.2">http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/Configure-1.2</a>
and put it in place:
<pre>mv Configure-1.2 /usr/src/linux/Configure</pre>
Then fetch the help texts from <a
href="Configure.help-1.2">http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/Configure.help-1.2</a>
and install them:
<pre>mv Configure.help-1.2 /usr/src/linux/Configure.help</pre>

You can now configure your kernel as before with <code>make
config</code>; if you answer one of the configuration questions with
<code>?</code>, you'll get help about that particular option.

<h3>Installing the new Configure script for kernel versions 1.3.x with x&lt;37</h2>

There is no Configure script for these kernel versions that uses the
help texts. Please upgrade to a newer kernel.

<h3>Installing the new Configure script for kernel versions 1.3.x with 36&lt;x&lt;47</h2>

These kernels include the help texts already. You
can find them as <code>Documentation/Configure.help</code> in the
kernel source tree.<p>

If you are running X, you will want to use the wonderful new X-based
kernel configuration tool (which uses the help texts); just type
<pre>make xconfig</pre>
instead of
<pre>make config</pre>
and go from there.<p>

If you don't have X, you can also install my Configure script replacement
(works only for kernels 1.3.36 and above). To do this, first
rename the old script:
<pre>mv /usr/src/linux/scripts/Configure /usr/src/linux/scripts/Configure.old</pre>
then download the new one from <a
href="Configure-1.3">http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/Configure-1.3</a>
and put it in place:
<pre>mv Configure-1.3 /usr/src/linux/scripts/Configure</pre>

You can now configure the kernel as before with <code>make
config</code>; if you answer one of the configuration questions with
<code>?</code>, you'll get help about that particular option.

<h3>Installing the new Configure script for kernel versions 1.3.x with
x>46 and versions 2.0.0 and above</h2>

Nothing has to be done here -- both the help texts and the Configure
script replacement made it into the official kernel source. If you answer a
question during the <code>make config</code> process with
<code>?</code>, you'll get help for that particular option. X users
will want to use
<code>make xconfig</code> instead. Another option is the super cool
text based menu directed configuration tool; just say <code>make
menuconfig</code> and follow your nose. The help texts are
automatically used by that script as well.
