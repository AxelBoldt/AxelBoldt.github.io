<h1>Research of Axel Boldt</h1>

<h2>Representation theory</h2>
I have worked on the representation theory of finite
dimensional algebras. Algebras are vectorspaces in which you can
multiply elements; the simplest example of an algebra is given by the set of all
n-by-n matrices over a field (e.g. over the real numbers). A
representation of an algebra is a homomorphism (a map that respects
addition, scalar multiplication and algebra multiplication)
of that algebra to a
matrix algebra. The idea is to understand and classify algebras by
means of their representations.<p>

In my <a href="research/diplom.pdf">Diplomarbeit</a>, written 1992
under Prof. Helmut Lenzing at the <a href="http://www.uni-paderborn.de/">University of Paderborn</a>, I developed a reduction
formula for the characteristic polynomial of the Coxeter transformation
of a path algebra and translated it into a <a
href="research/coxpoly_english">MAPLE program</a>. The detailed
description and explanation as well as the estimation of the
complexity of the program is contained in the Diplomarbeit.<p>

Later I extended the results of the Diplomarbeit to quivers with
relations and wrote an <a href="research/coxpolyart.pdf">article</a>
titled "Methods to Determine Coxeter Polynomials"
which has been published in the <em>Journal for
Linear Algebra and its Applications</em> 230 (1995), p.151-164.<p>

In August 96, I finished writing a <a href="research/onecycle.pdf">paper</a> with Martha Takane from UNAM,
Mexico City, about Coxeterpolynomials of unicyclic quivers. It has
since been published under the title "The spectral classes of unicyclic graphs" in the <em>Journal for Pure and
Applied Algebra</em> 133 (1998), no. 1-2, p.39-49.<p>

My <a href="research/thesis.pdf">Ph.D. thesis</a>, 
written under the direction of Prof. Birge Huisgen Zimmermann
at the <a href="http://www.math.ucsb.edu">Math
Department</a> of the <a href="http://www.ucsb.edu/">University of
California
at Santa Barbara</a>, was finished in May 1996. It deals with uniserial
modules over finite dimensional algebras, especially their patterns in
the Auslander-Reiten quiver. It also contains the work on Coxeter
polynomials.<p>

A joint article with Ahmad Mojiri of the University of Ottawa containing some results about Auslander-Reiten sequences
involving uniserial modules was finished in February 2004. The <a href="research/irrmaps7.pdf">preprint</a> is available. It has since been published (with some modifications) as "On uniserial modules in the Auslander-Reiten quiver", <em>Journal of Algebra</em>, Volume 319, Issue 5, 1 March 2008, Pages 1825-1850.

<h2>Real analysis</h2>
I have also worked with Craig Calcaterra and Michael Green from
<a href="http://www.metrostate.edu">Metropolitan State University,
Saint Paul</a> on some problems in analysis.<p>

The first article
deals with metric coordinate systems (a distinguished set of points of a metric space so that every other point can be uniquely identified
by the set of distances to the given points) and the solvability of
continuous dynamical systems specified in these coordinates. A <a href="http://vg01.met.vgwort.de/na/5a5cb77a0c214d749fb6240e5af7a974?l=http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0206253v1">preprint</a> is
available. The article was published as "Metric Coordinate Systems" in <em>Communications in Mathematical Analysis</em>, Volume 6, Number 2, Pages 79-108, February 2009.<p>

With Craig Calcaterra, I generalized the well-known flow-box theorem
from differential geometry to Lipschitz continuous vector fields on Banach spaces. A <a href="http://vg01.met.vgwort.de/na/f8c404dff28e4e558416677270d5be49?l=http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0305207v4">preprint</a> is
available; it has since been published as "Lipschitz Flow-box Theorem" in the <em>Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications</em> 338 (2008), p. 1108-1115.<p>

Craig Calcaterra and I also prepared the preprint <a href="http://vg01.met.vgwort.de/na/53ede8001d5c4761a4b57891ed51b36a?l=http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3795v1">Approximating with Gaussians</a> (2008), 
in which we show that linear combinations of translations of the Gaussian function exp(-x<sup>2</sup>) are dense in the space of square-integrable functions on the reals. This result entails that low-frequency trigonometric functions are also dense in a certain sense. 

<h2>Propaganda</h2>

With Michael Janich, I wrote the preprint <a href="http://vg01.met.vgwort.de/na/2a0bf3d1713949a1a58e42f615239bab?l=http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/research/globalmed.pdf">A Global Physician-Oriented Medical Information System</a> (2008), a proposal for an internet-based system that would allow the world's physicians to obtain free diagnostic assistance and treatment recommendations, and would make the aggregate outcome data available to medical researchers. This proposal was submitted to Google's $10 million <a href="http://www.project10tothe100.com/index.html">Project 10<sup>100</sup></a>. It was also submitted for publication to the journal <em>Computers in Biology and Medicine</em> but rejected.<p>

I wrote the article <a href="http://vg01.met.vgwort.de/na/feef29be48584318a8da4154d5b823ad?l=http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/research/arxiv.pdf">Extending Arxiv.org to Achieve Open Peer Review</a> (2010), outlining a simple extension to the <a href="http://www.arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a> preprint archive. 
This proposed extension would allow us to establish an open peer review and open publishing process in the sciences. It was published in the <em>Journal of Scholarly Publishing</em>, Voluume 42, Number 2 (January 2011), pp. 238-242.<p>
