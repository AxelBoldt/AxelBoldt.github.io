<h1>Two Answers to HIV-AIDS skeptics</h1>

One notorious genetics professor from Berkeley, Peter Duesberg,
frequently travels the campus circuit and preaches his message to
college kids (the most sexually active segment of society, by the way):
<em>AIDS is not an infectious disease</em>. He also wrote a couple of
books and articles about this theory.<p>

The internet, always eager to embrace fringe elements and lunatics
of all types, has galvanized a group of vocal Duesberg followers. They
can be seen in action on newsgroups such as <code>misc.health.aids</code> , various mailing
lists, and web sites such as AIDS Authority. Here are
two answers to these skeptics:<p>

<ul>
  <li>The National Institutes of Health distributed a paper titled <a
  href="etiology.html">Relationship between HIV and AIDS</a> on the
  Internet. It contains the mainstream scientific evidence for a
  causative role of HIV in AIDS, complete with all relevant
  references. I converted it to HTML and added a glossary and some
  remarks.
  <li>The skeptics, when telling sexually active persons
  that AIDS is not sexually transmitted, gamble with other people's
  lives. It would be much more ethical to gamble with their own money
  instead. At the same time, they could collect evidence supporting
  their claims. The key is to offer a <a href="study.html">life
  insurance policy for certain HIV infected people</a> and combine it
  with a scientific study. If they're right, they will strike it rich;
  if they're wrong, they will end up bankrupt.
</ul>

Here is how to contact the skeptics:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.duesberg.com">Peter Duesberg's site</a>
  <li>The usenet newsgroup <a
  href="news:misc.health.aids"><code>misc.health.aids</code></a>
  <li><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~raido/">Rethinking AIDS</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.aidsauthority.org">AIDS Authority</a>
</ul>

And here are some other rebuttals of the skeptics' position:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.skeptic.com/03.2.harris-aids.html">The AIDS
  Heresies</a>, an article written for the magazine Skeptic. Much more
  readable and less scientific than the NIH paper above.
  <li><a href="http://www.hyperreal.org/~lamont/rants/aids.html">Does HIV
  cause AIDS?</a> A usenet article focusing on ICL ("AIDS without HIV").
  <li><a
  href="http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/1290/">Gangbang's HIV/AIDS
  information page</a>, containing lots of hard facts about the virus.
</ul>
