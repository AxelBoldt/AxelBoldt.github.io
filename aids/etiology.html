The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by the
progressive loss of the <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+</a> helper/inducer subset of T <a href="appendix.html#lymphocytes">lymphocytes</a>,
leading to severe immunosuppression and <a href="appendix.html#const">constitutional disease</a>,
neurological complications, and opportunistic infections and <a href="appendix.html#neoplasm">neoplasms</a>
that rarely occur in persons with intact immune function. Although the
precise mechanisms leading to the destruction of the immune system
have not been fully delineated, abundant epidemiologic, virologic and
immunologic data support the conclusion that infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the underlying cause of AIDS.
<p>

The evidence for HIV's primary role in the <a href="appendix.html#pathogenesis">pathogenesis</a> of AIDS is
reviewed elsewhere (<a href="appendix.html#ho.b">Ho et al., 1987</a>; <a
href="appendix.html#fa.a">Fauci, 1988</a>, <a href="appendix.html#fa.b">1993a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#gr.f">Greene, 1993</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#le.k">Levy, 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#we.d">Weiss, 1993</a>). In
addition, many scientists (<a href="appendix.html#bl.b">Blattner et al.,
1988a</a>,<a href="appendix.html#bl.c">b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#gi.c">Ginsberg, 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ev.c">Evans,
1989a</a>,<a href="appendix.html#ev.d">b</a>, <a href="appendix.html#ev.e">1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#we.e">Weiss and Jaffe, 1990</a>; <a

href="appendix.html#ni.b">Nicoll and Brown, 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ha.i">Harris,
1995</a>) have responded to specific arguments from individuals who
assert that AIDS is not caused by HIV. The present discussion reviews
the AIDS epidemic and summarizes the evidence supporting HIV as the
cause of AIDS.
 
<h2><a name="def">The Definition of AIDS</a></h2>
 
 The term AIDS first appeared in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report (MMWR) of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 1982 to
describe "... a disease, at least moderately predictive of a defect
in cell-mediated immunity, occurring with no known cause for
diminished resistance to that disease" (<a href="appendix.html#cd.d">CDC, 1982b</a>). The initial CDC
list of AIDS-defining conditions, which included Kaposi's sarcoma
(<a href="#KS">KS</a>), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (<a href="#PCP">PCP</a>), Mycobacterium avium
complex (<a href="appendix.html#MAC">MAC</a>) and other conditions, has been updated on several
occasions, with significant revisions (<a href="appendix.html#cd.k">CDC, 1985a</a>, <a href="appendix.html#cd.l">1987a</a>, <a href="appendix.html#cd.o">1992a</a>).
<p>

 For surveillance purposes, the CDC currently defines AIDS in an adult
or adolescent age 13 years or older as the presence of one of 25
AIDS-indicator conditions, such as KS, PCP or <a href="appendix.html#disseminated">disseminated</a> MAC. In
children younger than 13 years, the definition of AIDS is similar to
that in adolescents and adults, except that <a href="appendix.html#lymphoid_interstitial_pneumonitis">lymphoid interstitial
pneumonitis</a> and recurrent bacterial infections are included in the
list of AIDS-defining conditions (<a href="appendix.html#cd.m">CDC, 1987b</a>). The case definition in
adults and adolescents was expanded in 1993 to include HIV infection
in an individual with a <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a> count less than 200 cells per
cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood (<a href="appendix.html#cd.o">CDC, 1992a</a>). The current surveillance
definition replaced criteria published in 1987 that were based on
clinical conditions and evidence of HIV infection but not on CD4+ T
cell determinations (<a href="appendix.html#cd.l">CDC, 1987a</a>).<a href="appendix.html#1">[1]</a>
<p>

 In many developing countries, where diagnostic facilities may be
minimal, epidemiologists employ a case definition based on the
presence of various clinical symptoms associated with immune
deficiency and the exclusion of other known causes of
immunosuppression, such as cancer or malnutrition (<a href="appendix.html#ry.a">Ryder and Mugewrwa,
1994a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#da.h">Davachi, 1994</a>).
 
<h2><a name="surveil">The Designation AIDS Is a Surveillance Tool</a></h2>
 
 Surveillance definitions of AIDS have proven useful epidemiologically
to track and quantify the recent epidemic of HIV-mediated
<a href="appendix.html#immunosuppression">immunosuppression</a> and its manifestations. However, AIDS represents
only the end stage of a continuous, progressive <a href="appendix.html#pathogenic">pathogenic</a> process,
beginning with primary infection with HIV, continuing with a chronic
phase that is usually <a href="appendix.html#asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a>, leading to progressively severe
symptoms and, ultimately, profound immunodeficiency and opportunistic
infections and <a href="appendix.html#neoplasm">neoplasms</a> (<a href="appendix.html#fa.b">Fauci, 1993a</a>). In clinical practice,
symptomatology and measurements of immune function, notably levels of
<a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T lymphocytes</a>, are used to guide the treatment of HIV-infected
persons rather than an all-or-nothing paradigm of AIDS/non-AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#cd.o">CDC,
1992a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.j">Sande et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#vo.b">Volberding and Graham, 1994</a>).
 
<h2><a name="quant">Quantifying the Epidemic</a></h2>
 
 Between June 1981 and Dec. 31, 1994, 441,528 cases of AIDS in the
United States, including 270,870 AIDS-related deaths, were reported to
the CDC (<a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC, 1995a</a>). AIDS is now the leading cause of death among
adults aged 25 to 44 in the United States (<a href="appendix.html#cd.t">CDC, 1995b</a>).
<p>

 Worldwide, 1,025,073 cases of AIDS were reported to the World Health
Organization (WHO) through December 1994, an increase of 20 percent
since December 1993 (<a href="appendix.html#wh.j">WHO, 1995a</a>). Allowing for under-diagnosis,
incomplete reporting and reporting delay, and based on the available
data on HIV infections around the world, the WHO estimates that over
4.5 million AIDS <a href="appendix.html#cumulative">cumulative</a> had occurred worldwide by late 1994
and that 19.5 million people worldwide had been infected with HIV
since the beginning of the epidemic (<a href="appendix.html#wh.j">WHO, 1995a</a>). By the year 2000,
the WHO estimates that 30 to 40 million people will have been infected
with HIV and that 10 million people will have developed AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#wh.i">WHO,
1994</a>). The Global AIDS Policy Coalition has developed a considerably
higher estimate--perhaps up to 110 million HIV infections and 25
million AIDS cases by the turn of the century (<a href="appendix.html#ma.a">Mann et al., 1992a</a>).<a href="appendix.html#2">[2]</a>
 
<h2><a name="history">A Brief History of the Emergence of AIDS</a></h2>
 
 In 1981, clinical investigators in New York and California observed
among young, previously healthy, homosexual men an unusual clustering
of cases of rare diseases, notably Kaposi's sarcoma (<a href="#KS">KS</a>) and
opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (<a href="#PCP">PCP</a>),
as well as cases of unexplained, persistent <a href="appendix.html#lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</a> (<a href="appendix.html#cd.a">CDC,
1981a</a>,<a href="appendix.html#cd.b">b</a>, <a href="appendix.html#cd.c">1982a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ma.h">Masur et al., 1981</a>; <a href="appendix.html#go.f">Gottlieb et al., 1981</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#fr.f">Friedman-Kien, 1981</a>). It soon became evident that these men had a
common immunologic deficit, an impairment in cell-mediated immunity
resulting from a significant loss of "T-helper" cells, which bear the
<a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4</a> marker (<a href="appendix.html#go.f">Gottlieb et al., 1981</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ma.h">Masur et al., 1981</a>; <a href="appendix.html#si.a">Siegal et al.,
1981</a>; <a href="appendix.html#am.c">Ammann et al., 1983a</a>).
<p>

 The widespread occurrence of KS and PCP in young people with no
underlying disease or history of immunosuppressive therapy was
unprecedented. Searches of the medical literature, autopsy records and
tumor registries revealed that these diseases previously had occurred
at very low levels in the United States (<a href="appendix.html#cd.b">CDC, 1981b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#cd.h">CDC, 1982f</a>).
<p>

 <a name="KS">KS</a>, a very rare skin <a href="appendix.html#neoplasm">neoplasm</a>, had affected mostly older men of
Mediterranean origin or cancer or transplant patients undergoing
immunosuppressive therapy (<a href="appendix.html#ga.h">Gange and Jones, 1978</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.d">Safai and Good,
1981</a>). Before the AIDS epidemic, the annual incidence of Kaposi's
sarcoma in the United States was 0.02 to 0.06 per 100,000 population
(<a href="appendix.html#ro.e">Rothman, 1962a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#oe">Oettle, 1962</a>). In addition, a more aggressive form of
KS that generally occurred in younger individuals was seen in certain
parts of Africa (<a href="appendix.html#ro.f">Rothman, 1962b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.e">Safai, 1984a</a>). By 1984, never-married
men in San Francisco were found to be 2,000 times more likely to
develop KS than during the years 1973 to 1979 (<a href="appendix.html#wi">Williams et al.,
1994</a>). As of Dec. 31, 1994, 36,693 patients with AIDS in the United
States with a definitive diagnosis of KS had been reported to the CDC
(<a href="appendix.html#cd.t">CDC, 1995b</a>).
<p>

 <a name="PCP">PCP</a>, a lung infection caused by a <a href="appendix.html#pathogen">pathogen</a> to which most individuals
are exposed with no undue consequences, was extremely rare prior to
1981 in individuals other than those receiving immunosuppressive
therapy or among the chronically malnourished, such as certain Eastern
European children following World War II (<a href="appendix.html#wa.d">Walzer, 1990</a>). A 1967
survey, for example, found only 107 U.S. cases of PCP reported in the
medical literature up to that point, virtually all among individuals
with underlying immunosuppressive conditions or who had undergone
immunosuppressive therapy (<a href="appendix.html#le.a">Le Clair, 1969</a>). In that year, CDC became
the sole supplier in the United States of pentamidine isethionate,
then the only recommended PCP therapy, and began collecting data on
each PCP case diagnosed and treated in this country. After reviewing
requests for pentamidine in the period 1967 to 1970, researchers found
only one case of confirmed PCP without a known underlying condition
(<a href="appendix.html#wa.c">Walzer et al., 1974</a>). In the period immediately prior to the
recognition of AIDS, January 1976 to June 1980, CDC received only one
request for pentamidine isethionate to treat an adult in the United
States who had PCP and no underlying disease (<a href="appendix.html#cd.h">CDC, 1982f</a>). In 1981
alone, 42 requests for pentamidine were received to treat patients
with PCP and no known underlying disorders (<a href="appendix.html#cd.h">CDC, 1982f</a>). By Dec. 31,
1994, 127,626 individuals with AIDS in the United States with
definitive diagnoses of PCP had been reported to the CDC (<a href="appendix.html#cd.t">CDC, 1995b</a>).
<p>

 Another rare opportunistic disease, <a
href="appendix.html#disseminated">disseminated</a> infection with the
Mycobacterium avium complex (<a href="appendix.html#MAC">MAC</a>), also was seen frequently in the
first AIDS patients (<a href="appendix.html#za.d">Zakowski et al., 1982</a>; <a href="appendix.html#gr.d">Greene et al.,
1982</a>). Prior to 1981, only 32 individuals with disseminated MAC
disease had been described in the medical literature (<a href="appendix.html#ma.i">Masur,
1982a</a>). By Dec. 31, 1994, the CDC had received reports of 28,954
U.S. AIDS patients with definitive diagnoses of disseminated MAC (<a href="appendix.html#cd.t">CDC,
1995b</a>).
 
<h2><a name="theory">Initial Theories</a></h2>
 
 The fact that homosexual men constituted the initial population in
which AIDS occurred in the United States led some to surmise that a
homosexual lifestyle was specifically related to the disease (<a href="appendix.html#go.a">Goedert
et al., 1982</a>; <a href="appendix.html#hu.c">Hurtenbach and Shearer, 1982</a>; <a href="appendix.html#so.b">Sonnabend et al., 1983</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#du.i">Durack, 1981</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ma.l">Mavligit et al., 1984</a>). These early suggestions that
AIDS resulted from behavior specific to the homosexual population were
largely dismissed when the syndrome was observed in distinctly
different groups in the United States: in male and female injection
drug users; in <a href="appendix.html#hemophilia">hemophiliacs</a> and blood transfusion recipients; among
female sex partners of bisexual men, recipients of blood or blood
products, or injection drug users; and among infants born to mothers
with AIDS or with a history of injection drug use (<a href="appendix.html#cd.d">CDC, 1982b</a>,<a href="appendix.html#cd.e">c</a>,<a href="appendix.html#cd.f">d</a>,<a href="appendix.html#cd.h">f</a>,
<a href="appendix.html#cd.i">1983a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#po.a">Poon et al., 1983</a>; <a href="appendix.html#el">Elliot et al., 1983</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ma.j">Masur et al., 1982b</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#da.i">Davis et al., 1983</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ha.h">Harris et al., 1983</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ru">Rubinstein et al., 1983</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#ol.b">Oleske et al., 1983</a>; <a href="appendix.html#am.d">Ammann et al., 1983b</a>). In 1983, for example, a
study found that <a name="hemophilia">hemophiliacs</a> with no history of any of the proposed
causes of AIDS in homosexual men had developed the syndrome, and some
of the men had apparently transmitted the infection to their wives
(<a href="appendix.html#de.c">deShazo et al., 1983</a>).
<p>

 Many public health experts concluded that the clustering of AIDS
cases (<a href="appendix.html#au">Auerbach et al., 1984</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ga.j">Gazzard et al., 1984</a>) and the occurrence
of cases in diverse risk groups could be explained only if AIDS were
caused by an infectious microorganism transmitted in the manner of
<a href="appendix.html#hepatitis">hepatitis B</a> virus (HBV): by sexual contact, by <a href="appendix.html#inoculation">inoculation</a> with blood
or blood products, and from mother to newborn infant (<a href="appendix.html#fr.b">Francis et al.,
1983</a>; <a href="appendix.html#cu.a">Curran et al., 1984</a>; <a href="appendix.html#am.a">AMA, 1984</a>; <a href="appendix.html#cd.h">CDC, 1982f</a>, <a href="appendix.html#cd.i">1983a</a>,<a href="appendix.html#cd.j">b</a>).
<p>

 Early suspects for the cause of AIDS were <a href="appendix.html#cytomegalovirus">cytomegalovirus</a> (CMV),
because of its association with immunosuppression, and <a href="appendix.html#epstein">Epstein-Barr
virus</a> (EBV), which has an affinity for <a href="appendix.html#lymphocytes">lymphocytes</a> (<a href="appendix.html#go.f">Gottlieb et al.,
1981</a>; <a href="appendix.html#hy">Hymes et al., 1981</a>; <a href="appendix.html#cd.h">CDC, 1982f</a>). However, AIDS was a new
phenomenon, and these viruses already had a worldwide
distribution. Comparative <a href="appendix.html#seroprevalence">seroprevalence</a> studies showed no convincing
evidence to assign these viruses or other known agents a primary role
in the syndrome (<a href="appendix.html#ro.c">Rogers et al., 1983</a>). Also lacking was evidence that
these viruses, when isolated from patients with AIDS, differed
significantly from strains found in healthy individuals or from
strains found in the years preceding the emergence of AIDS (AMA,
1984).
 
<h2><a name="retro">Retrovirus Hypothesis</a></h2>
 
 By 1983, several research groups had focused on <a href="appendix.html#retrovirus">retroviruses</a> for
clues to the cause of AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#ga.f">Gallo and Montagnier, 1987</a>). Two recently
recognized retroviruses, HTLV-I and HTLV-II, were the only viruses
then known to preferentially infect helper T <a href="appendix.html#lymphocytes">lymphocytes</a>, the cells
depleted in people with AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#ga.d">Gallo and Reitz, 1982</a>; <a href="appendix.html#po.b">Popovic et al.,
1984</a>). The pattern of HTLV transmission was similar to that seen among
AIDS patients: HTLV was transmitted by sexual contact, from mother to
child or by exposure to infected blood (<a href="appendix.html#es.b">Essex, 1982</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ga.d">Gallo and Reitz,
1982</a>). In addition, HTLV-I was known to cause mild immunosuppression,
and a related retrovirus, the <a href="appendix.html#lymphotropic">lymphotropic</a> feline leukemia virus
(FeLV), caused <a href="appendix.html#lethal">lethal</a> immunosuppression in cats (<a href="appendix.html#es.a">Essex et al., 1975</a>).
<p>

 In May 1983, the first report providing experimental evidence for an
association between a retrovirus and AIDS was published
(<a href="appendix.html#ba.g">Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983</a>). After finding <a href="appendix.html#antibodies">antibodies</a> cross-reactive
with HTLV-I in a homosexual patient with <a href="appendix.html#lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</a>, a group led
by Dr. Luc Montagnier isolated a previously unrecognized virus
containing <a href="appendix.html#reverse_transcriptase">reverse transcriptase</a> that was <a href="appendix.html#cytopathic">cytopathic</a> for <a href="appendix.html#cord-blood">cord-blood</a>
<a href="appendix.html#lymphocytes">lymphocytes</a> (<a href="appendix.html#ba.g">Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983</a>). This virus later became
known as lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV). The French group
subsequently reported that LAV was <a href="appendix.html#tropic">tropic</a> for T-helper cells, in which
it grew to substantial <a href="appendix.html#titer">titers</a> and caused cell death (<a href="appendix.html#kl.a">Klatzmann et al.,
1984a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mo.a">Montagnier et al., 1984</a>).
<p>

 In 1984, a considerable amount of new data added to the evidence for
a retroviral <a href="appendix.html#etiology">etiology</a> for AIDS. Researchers at the National Institutes
of Health reported the isolation of a <a href="appendix.html#cytopathic">cytopathic</a> T-<a href="appendix.html#lymphotropic">lymphotropic</a> virus
from 48 different people, including 18 of 21 with pre-AIDS, three of
four clinically normal mothers of children with AIDS, 26 of 72
children and adults with AIDS, and one (who later developed AIDS) of
22 healthy homosexuals (<a href="appendix.html#ga.e">Gallo et al., 1984</a>). The virus, named
HTLV-III, could not be found in 115 healthy heterosexual subjects.
<p>

<a href="appendix.html#antibodies">Antibodies</a> reactive with HTLV-III <a href="appendix.html#antigen">antigens</a> were found in <a href="appendix.html#serum">serum</a>
samples of 88 percent of 48 patients with AIDS, 79 percent of 14
homosexuals with pre-AIDS, and fewer than 1 percent of hundreds of
healthy heterosexuals (<a href="appendix.html#sa.k">Sarngadharan et al., 1984</a>).
<p>

 Shortly thereafter, the researchers found that 100 percent (34 of 34)
of AIDS patients tested were positive for HTLV-III antibodies in a
study in which none of 14 controls had antibodies (<a href="appendix.html#sa.f">Safai et al.,
1984b</a>).
<p>

 In a study in the United Kingdom reported later that year,
investigators found that 30 of 31 AIDS patients tested were
<a href="appendix.html#seropositive">seropositive</a> for HTLV-III antibodies, as were 110 of 124 individuals
with persistent generalized <a href="appendix.html#lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</a> (<a href="appendix.html#ch.d">Cheingsong-Popov et al.,
1984</a>). None of more than 1,000 blood donors selected randomly had
antibodies to HTLV-III in this study.
<p>

 During the same time period, HTLV-III was isolated from the semen of
patients with AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#za.b">Zagury et al., 1984</a>, <a href="appendix.html#ho.c">Ho et al., 1984</a>), findings
consistent with the epidemiologic data demonstrating AIDS transmission
via sexual contact.
<p>

 Researchers in San Francisco subsequently reported the isolation of a
retrovirus they named the AIDS-associated retrovirus (ARV) from AIDS
patients in different risk groups, as well as from <a href="appendix.html#asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> people
from AIDS risk groups (<a href="appendix.html#le.i">Levy et al., 1984</a>). The researchers isolated
ARV from 27 of 55 patients with AIDS or lymphadenopathy syndrome; they
detected antibodies to ARV in 90 percent of 113 individuals with the
same conditions. Like HTLV-III and LAV, ARV grew substantially in
<a href="appendix.html#peripheral_blood">peripheral blood</a> mononuclear cells and killed <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cells</a>. The same
group subsequently isolated ARV from genital secretions of women with
antibodies to the virus, data consistent with the observation that men
could contract AIDS following contact with a woman infected with the
virus (<a href="appendix.html#wo">Wofsy et al., 1986</a>).
<p>

 During the same period, HTLV-III and ARV were isolated from the
brains of children and adults with AIDS-associated <a href="appendix.html#encephalopathy">encephalopathy</a>,
which suggested a role for these viruses in the central nervous system
disorders seen in many patients with AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#le.j">Levy et al., 1985</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ho.d">Ho et
al., 1985</a>).
<p>

 By 1985, analyses of the nucleotide sequences of HTLV-III, LAV and
ARV demonstrated that the three viruses belonged to the same
retroviral family and were strikingly similar (<a href="appendix.html#wa.b">Wain-Hobson et al.,
1985</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ra.c">Ratner et al., 1985</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.i">Sanchez-Pescador et al., 1985</a>). In 1986,
the International Committee of Viral Taxonomy renamed the viruses the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<a href="appendix.html#co.b">Coffin et al., 1986</a>).


<h2><a name="sero">Seroprevalence Surveys</a></h2>
 
 Serologic tests for <a href="appendix.html#antibodies">antibodies</a> to HIV, developed in 1984
(<a href="appendix.html#sa.k">Sarngadharan et al., 1984</a>; <a href="appendix.html#po.b">Popovic et al., 1984</a>; reviewed in
<a href="appendix.html#br.b">Brookmeyer and Gail, 1994</a>), have enabled researchers to conduct
hundreds of <a href="appendix.html#seroprevalence">seroprevalence</a> surveys throughout the world. Using these
tests, investigators have repeatedly demonstrated that the occurrence
of AIDS-like illnesses in different populations has closely followed
the appearance of HIV antibodies (<a href="appendix.html#un">U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1994</a>). For example, <a href="appendix.html#retrospective">retrospective</a> examination of sera collected in the
late 1970s in association with <a href="appendix.html#hepatitis">hepatitis B</a> studies in New York, San
Francisco and Los Angeles suggests that HIV entered the
U.S. population sometime in the late 1970s (<a href="appendix.html#ja.c">Jaffe et al., 1985a</a>). In
1978, 4.5 percent of men in the San Francisco <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> had antibodies to
HIV (<a href="appendix.html#ja.c">Jaffe et al., 1985a</a>). The first cases of AIDS in homosexual men
in San Francisco were reported in 1981, and by 1984, more than
two-thirds of the San Francisco <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> had HIV antibodies and almost
one-third had developed AIDS-related conditions (<a href="appendix.html#ja.c">Jaffe et al.,
1985a</a>). By the end of 1992, approximately 70 percent of 539 men in the
San Francisco cohort with a well-documented date of HIV <a href="appendix.html#seroconversion">seroconversion</a>
before 1983 had developed an AIDS-defining condition or had a <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T
cell</a> count of less than 200/mm3; another 11 percent had CD4+ T cell
counts between 200 and 500/mm3 (<a href="appendix.html#bu.a">Buchbinder et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 <a href="appendix.html#retrospective">Retrospective</a> tests of the U.S. blood supply have shown that, in
1978, at least one batch of <a href="appendix.html#Factor_VIII">Factor VIII</a> was contaminated with HIV
(<a href="appendix.html#ev">Evatt et al., 1985</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ar">Aronson, 1993</a>). Factor VIII was given to some
2,300 males in the United States that year. In July 1982, the first
cases of AIDS in <a href="appendix.html#hemophilia">hemophiliacs</a> were reported (<a href="appendix.html#cd.e">CDC, 1982c</a>). Through
Dec. 31, 1994, 3,863 individuals in the United States with hemophilia
or other <a href="appendix.html#coagulation">coagulation</a> disorders had been diagnosed with AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC,
1995a</a>).
<p>

 Elsewhere in the world, a similar chronological association between
HIV and AIDS has been noted. The appearance of HIV in the blood supply
has preceded or coincided with the occurrence of AIDS cases in every
country and region where cases of AIDS have been reported (<a href="appendix.html#in">Institute
of Medicine, 1986</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ch.e">Chin and Mann, 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#cu.b">Curran et al., 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pi.b">Piot et
al., 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ma.b">Mann, 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ma.a">Mann et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#un">U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1994</a>). For example, a review of serosurveys associated with dengue
fever in the Caribbean found that the earliest evidence of HIV
infection in Haiti appeared in samples from 1979 (<a href="appendix.html#pa.f">Pape et al., 1983,
1993</a>); the first cases of AIDS in Haiti and in Haitians in the United
States were reported in the early 1980s (<a href="appendix.html#cd.g">CDC, 1982e</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.f">Pape et al.,
1983</a>, <a href="appendix.html#pa.g">1993</a>).
<p>

 In Africa between 1981 and 1983, clinical epidemics of chronic,
life-threatening <a href="appendix.html#enteropathic">enteropathic</a> diseases
("slim disease"), <a href="appendix.html#cryptococcal_meningitis">cryptococcal
meningitis</a>, progressive <a href="#KS">KS</a> and <a
href="appendix.html#eso">esophageal</a>  <a href="appendix.html#candidiasis">candidiasis</a> were recognized
in Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire and Zambia, and in 1983 the first
AIDS cases among Africans were reported (<a href="appendix.html#qu.a">Quinn et al., 1986</a>; <a href="appendix.html#es.c">Essex,
1994</a>). The earliest blood sample from Africa from which HIV has been
recovered is from a possible AIDS patient in Zaire, tested in
connection with a 1976 <a href="appendix.html#Ebola_virus">Ebola virus</a> outbreak (<a href="appendix.html#ge.c">Getchell et al., 1987</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#my">Myers et al., 1992</a>).
<p>

 Serologic data have suggested the presence of HIV infection as early
as 1959 in Zaire (<a href="appendix.html#na">Nahmias et al., 1986</a>). Other investigators have
found evidence of HIV <a href="appendix.html#proviral">proviral</a> <a href="appendix.html#DNA">DNA</a> in tissues of a sailor who died in
Manchester, England, in 1959 (<a href="appendix.html#co.p">Corbitt et al., 1990</a>). In the latter
case, this finding may have represented a contamination with a virus
isolated at a much later date (<a href="appendix.html#zh">Zhu and Ho, 1995</a>).
<p>

 HIV did not become epidemic until 20 to 30 years later, perhaps
because of the migration of poor and young sexually active individuals
from rural areas to urban centers in developing countries, with
subsequent return migration and, internationally, due to civil wars,
tourism, business travel and the drug trade (<a href="appendix.html#qu.b">Quinn, 1994</a>).
 
<h2><a name="lenti">HIV and Other Lentiviruses</a></h2>
 
 As a <a href="appendix.html#retrovirus">retrovirus</a>, HIV is an <a href="appendix.html#RNA">RNA</a> virus that codes for the enzyme
<a href="appendix.html#reverse_transcriptase">reverse transcriptase</a>, which transcribes the viral genomic RNA into a
<a href="appendix.html#DNA">DNA</a> copy that ultimately integrates into the host cell genome (<a href="appendix.html#fa.a">Fauci,
1988</a>). Within the retrovirus family, HIV is classified as a
lentivirus, having genetic and <a href="appendix.html#morphologic">morphologic</a> similarities to animal
lentiviruses such as those infecting cats (feline immunodeficiency
virus), sheep (visna virus), goats (caprine arthritis-encephalitis
virus), and non-human primates (simian immunodeficiency virus)
(<a href="appendix.html#st.b">Stowring et al., 1979</a>; <a href="appendix.html#go.e">Gonda et al., 1985</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ha.b">Haase, 1986</a>; <a href="appendix.html#te.a">Temin, 1988</a>,
<a href="appendix.html#te.b">1989</a>). Like HIV in humans, these animal viruses primarily infect cells
of the immune system, including T <a href="appendix.html#lymphocytes">lymphocytes</a> and <a href="appendix.html#macrophages">macrophages</a> (<a href="appendix.html#ha.b">Haase,
1986</a>, <a href="appendix.html#ha.a">1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#le.k">Levy, 1993</a>).
<p>

 Lentiviruses often cause immunodeficiency in their hosts in addition
to slow, progressive wasting disorders, neurodegeneration and death
(<a href="appendix.html#ha.b">Haase, 1986</a>, <a href="appendix.html#ha.a">1990</a>). SIV, for example, infects several subspecies of
macaque monkeys, causing diarrhea, wasting, <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a> depletion,
opportunistic infections and death (<a href="appendix.html#de.d">Desrosiers, 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#fu.a">Fultz,
1993</a>). HIV is closely related to SIV, as evidenced by viral protein
cross-reactivity and genetic sequence similarities (<a href="appendix.html#fr.a">Franchini et al.,
1987</a>; <a href="appendix.html#hi.b">Hirsch et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#de.d">Desrosiers, 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#my">Myers, 1992</a>).
<p>

 One feature that distinguishes lentiviruses from other retroviruses
is the remarkable complexity of their viral genomes. Most retroviruses
that are capable of replication contain only three genes--env, gag and
pol (<a href="appendix.html#va.b">Varmus, 1988</a>). HIV contains not only these essential genes but
also the complex regulatory genes tat, rev, nef, and auxiliary genes
vif, vpr and vpu (<a href="appendix.html#gr.g">Greene, 1991</a>). The actions of these additional genes
probably contribute to the profound <a href="appendix.html#pathogen">pathogenicity</a> that differentiates
HIV from many other retroviruses.
<p>

 <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cells</a>, the cells depleted in AIDS patients, are primary
targets of HIV because of the affinity of the gp120 glycoprotein
component of the <a href="appendix.html#viral_envelope">viral envelope</a> for the CD4 molecule (<a href="appendix.html#da.e">Dalgleish et
al., 1984</a>; <a href="appendix.html#kl.b">Klatzmann et al., 1984b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mc.a">McDougal et al., 1985a</a>,
<a href="appendix.html#mc.c">1986</a>). These so-called T-helper cells coordinate a number of critical
immunologic functions. The loss of these cells results in the
progressive impairment of the immune system and is associated with a
deteriorating clinical course (<a href="appendix.html#pa.a">Pantaleo et al., 1993a</a>). In advanced
HIV disease, abnormalities of virtually every component of the immune
system are evident (<a href="appendix.html#fa.b">Fauci, 1993a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.a">Pantaleo et al., 1993a</a>).
 
<h2><a name="infection">Course of HIV Infection</a></h2>
 
 Primary HIV infection is associated with a burst of HIV <a href="appendix.html#viremia">viremia</a> and
often a <a href="appendix.html#concomitant">concomitant</a> abrupt decline of <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+
T cells</a> in the <a href="appendix.html#peripheral_blood">peripheral
blood</a> (<a href="appendix.html#co.n">Cooper et al., 1985</a>; <a href="appendix.html#da.b">Daar et al., 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ti">Tindall and Cooper,
1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#cl">Clark et al., 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.a">Pantaleo et al., 1993a</a>, <a href="appendix.html#pa.c">1994</a>). The decrease
in circulating <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cells</a> during primary infection is probably due
both to HIV-mediated cell killing and to <a href="appendix.html#re-trafficking">re-trafficking</a> of cells to
the lymphoid tissues and other organs (<a href="appendix.html#fa.b">Fauci, 1993a</a>).
<p>

 The median period of time between infection with HIV and the onset of
clinically apparent disease is approximately 10 years in western
countries, according to prospective studies of homosexual men in which
dates of <a href="appendix.html#seroconversion">seroconversion</a> are known (<a href="appendix.html#le.e">Lemp et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.a">Pantaleo et al.,
1993a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#he">Hessol et al., 1994</a>). Similar estimates of <a href="appendix.html#asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> periods
have been made for HIV-infected blood-transfusion recipients,
injection drug users and adult <a href="appendix.html#hemophilia">hemophiliacs</a> (reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#al.a">Alcabes et
al., 1993a</a>).
<p>

 HIV disease, however, is not uniformly expressed in all
individuals. A small proportion of persons infected with the virus
develop AIDS and die within months following primary infection, while
approximately 5 percent of HIV-infected individuals exhibit no signs
of disease progression even after 12 or more years (<a href="appendix.html#pa.d">Pantaleo et al.,
1995a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ca">Cao et al., 1995</a>). Host factors such as age or genetic
differences among individuals, the level of virulence of the
individual strain of virus, as well as influences such as co-infection
with other microbes may determine the rate and severity of HIV disease
expression in different people (<a href="appendix.html#fa.b">Fauci, 1993a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.a">Pantaleo et al.,
1993a</a>). Such variables have been termed "clinical illness promotion
factors" or co-factors and appear to influence the onset of clinical
disease among those infected with any <a href="appendix.html#pathogen">pathogen</a> (<a href="appendix.html#ev.b">Evans, 1982</a>). Most
people infected with <a href="appendix.html#hepatitis">hepatitis B</a>, for example, show no symptoms or
only jaundice and clear their infection, while others suffer disease
ranging from chronic liver inflammation to <a href="appendix.html#cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> and
<a href="appendix.html#hepatocellular_carcinoma">hepatocellular carcinoma</a> (<a href="appendix.html#ro.b">Robinson, 1990</a>). Co-factors probably also
determine why some smokers develop lung cancer, while others do not.
<p>

 As disease progresses, increasing amounts of infectious virus, viral
<a href="appendix.html#antigen">antigens</a> and HIV-specific nucleic acids in the body correlate with a
worsening clinical course (<a href="appendix.html#al.f">Allain et al., 1987</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ni.a">Nicholson et al.,
1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ho.a">Ho et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sc.e">Schnittman et al., 1989</a>, <a href="appendix.html#sc.f">1990a</a>, <a href="appendix.html#sc.g">1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ma.k">Mathez et
al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ge.a">Genesca et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#hu.a">Hufert et al., 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.a">Saag et al.,
1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ao">Aoki-Sei et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ye">Yerly et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ba.d">Bagnarelli et al.,
1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#fe.c">Ferre et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mi">Michael et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.b">Pantaleo et al.,
1993b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#gu.b">Gupta et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#co.i">Connor et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.h">Saksela et al., 1994</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#di.a">Dickover et al., 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#da.c">Daar et al., 1995</a>; <a href="appendix.html#fu.b">Furtado et al., 1995</a>).
<p>

 Cross-sectional studies in adults and children have shown that levels
of infectious HIV or <a href="appendix.html#proviral">proviral</a> <a href="appendix.html#DNA">DNA</a> in the blood are substantially
higher in patients with AIDS than in <a href="appendix.html#asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> patients (<a href="appendix.html#ho.a">Ho et al.,
1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#co.m">Coombs et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.a">Saag et al., 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sr">Srugo et al., 1991</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#mi">Michael et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ao">Aoki-Sei et al., 1992</a>). In both blood and lymph
tissues from HIV-infected individuals, researchers at the National
Institutes of Health found <a href="appendix.html#viral_burden">viral burden</a> and replication to be
substantially higher in patients with AIDS than in early-stage
patients (<a href="appendix.html#pa.b">Pantaleo et al., 1993b</a>). This group also found deterioration
of the architecture and microenvironment of the lymphoid tissue to a
greater extent in late-stage patients than in asymptomatic
individuals. The dissolution of the follicular dendritic cell network
of the lymph node germinal center and the progressive loss of
antigen-presenting capacity are likely critical factors that
contribute to the immune deficiency seen in individuals with AIDS
(<a href="appendix.html#pa.b">Pantaleo et al., 1993b</a>).
<p>

 More recently, the same group studied 15 long-term non-progressors,
defined as individuals infected for more than seven years (usually
more than 10 years) who received no antiretroviral therapy and showed
no decline in <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cells</a>. They found that <a
href="appendix.html#viral_burden">viral burden</a> and viral
replication in the peripheral blood and in lymph nodes, measured by
<a href="appendix.html#DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="appendix.html#RNA">RNA</a> <a href="appendix.html#PCR">PCR</a>, respectively, were at least 10 times lower than in 18
HIV-infected individuals whose disease progression was more
typical. In addition, the lymph node architecture in long-term
non-progressors remained intact (<a href="appendix.html#pa.d">Pantaleo et al., 1995a</a>).
<p>

 Longitudinal studies also have quantified viral burden and
replication in the blood and their relationship to disease progression
(<a href="appendix.html#sc.f">Schnittman et al., 1990a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#co.i">Connor et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.h">Saksela et al., 1994</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#da.c">Daar et al., 1995</a>; <a href="appendix.html#fu.b">Furtado et al., 1995</a>). In a study of <a href="appendix.html#asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a>
HIV-infected individuals who ultimately developed rapidly progressive
disease, the number of <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cells</a> in which HIV <a href="appendix.html#DNA">DNA</a> could be found
increased over time, whereas this did not occur in patients with
stable disease (<a href="appendix.html#sc.f">Schnittman et al., 1990a</a>). Using serial blood samples
from HIV-infected individuals who had a precipitous drop in CD4+ T
cells followed by a rapid progression to AIDS, other groups found a
significant increase in the levels of HIV DNA concurrent with or prior
to CD4+ T cell decline (<a href="appendix.html#co.i">Connor et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#da.c">Daar et al.,
1995</a>). Increased expression of HIV <a href="appendix.html#mRNA">mRNA</a> in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells has also been shown to precede clinically defined
progression of disease (<a href="appendix.html#sa.h">Saksela et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 In the longitudinal Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), homosexual
and bisexual men for whom the time of <a href="appendix.html#seroconversion">seroconversion</a> had been
documented had increasing levels of both <a href="appendix.html#plasma">plasma</a> HIV <a href="appendix.html#RNA">RNA</a> and
intracellular RNA as disease progressed and had CD4+ T cell numbers
that declined (<a href="appendix.html#gu.b">Gupta et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#me.a">Mellors et al., 1995</a>). Men who
remained <a href="appendix.html#asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> with stable CD4+ T cell numbers maintained
extremely low levels of viral RNA. These findings suggest that plasma
HIV RNA levels are a strong, CD4-independent predictor of rapid
progression to AIDS. Another longitudinal study found that increasing
plasma RNA levels were highly predictive of the development of
zidovudine (<a href="appendix.html#AZT">AZT</a>) resistance and death in patients on long-term therapy
with that drug (<a href="appendix.html#va.a">Vahey et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 Other evidence suggests that changes in viral load due to changes in
therapy can predict clinical benefit in patients. It was recently
found that the amount of HIV RNA in the peripheral blood decreased in
patients who switched to didanosine (ddI) after taking AZT and
increased in patients who continued to take AZT (<a href="appendix.html#nt">NTIS, 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#we.g">Welles et
al., 1995</a>). Decreases in HIV RNA were associated with fewer
progressions to new, previously undiagnosed AIDS-defining diseases or
death. This study provided the first evidence that a therapy-induced
reduction of HIV viral load is associated with clinical
outcome. Similarly, studies of blood samples collected serially from
HIV-infected patients found that a decrease in HIV RNA copy number in
the first months following treatment with AZT strongly correlated with
improved clinical outcome (<a href="appendix.html#ob">O'Brien et al., 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ju.b">Jurriaans et al.,
1995</a>).
<p>

 The emergence of HIV variants that are more <a href="appendix.html#cytopathic">cytopathic</a> and replicate
in a wider range of susceptible cells <a href="appendix.html#vitro">in vitro</a> has also been shown to
correlate with disease progression in HIV-infected individuals (<a href="appendix.html#fe.a">Fenyo
et al., 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#te.d">Tersmette et al., 1988</a>, <a href="appendix.html#te.e">1989a</a>,<a href="appendix.html#te.f">b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ri.c">Richman and Bozzette,
1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#co.i">Connor et al., 1993</a>, <a href="appendix.html#co.j">Connor and Ho, 1994a</a>,<a href="appendix.html#co.k">b</a>). Similar results
have been seen <a href="appendix.html#vivo">in vivo</a> with macaques infected with molecularly cloned
SIV (<a href="appendix.html#ko.b">Kodama et al., 1993</a>). It has also been reported that HIV isolates
from patients who progress to AIDS have a higher rate of replication
compared with HIV isolates from individuals who remain <a href="appendix.html#asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a>
(<a href="appendix.html#fe.a">Fenyo et al., 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#te.e">Tersmette et al., 1989a</a>), and that rapidly
replicating variants of HIV emerge during the asymptomatic stage of
infection prior to disease progression (<a href="appendix.html#te.f">Tersmette et al., 1989b</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#co.k">Connor and Ho, 1994b</a>).
 
<h2><a name="immun">Immunologic Profile of People With AIDS</a></h2>
 
 It is well established that a number of viral, <a href="appendix.html#rickettsial">rickettsial</a>, fungal,
<a href="appendix.html#protozoal">protozoal</a> and bacterial infections can cause transient T cell
decreases (<a href="appendix.html#ch.b">Chandra, 1983</a>). Immune deficiencies due to tumors,
autoimmune diseases, rare <a href="appendix.html#congenital">congenital</a> disorders, chemotherapy and other
factors have been shown to render certain individuals susceptible to
opportunistic infections (<a href="appendix.html#am.e">Ammann, 1991</a>). As mentioned above, chronic
malnutrition following World War II resulted in <a href="#PCP">PCP</a> in Eastern
European children (<a href="appendix.html#wa.d">Walzer, 1990</a>). Transplant recipients treated with
immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin and glucocorticoids often
suffer recurrent diseases due to <a href="appendix.html#pathogen">pathogens</a>
such as <a href="appendix.html#varicella_zoster_virus">varicella zoster virus</a> and <a href="appendix.html#cytomegalovirus">cytomegalovirus</a> that also cause disease in HIV-infected
individuals (<a href="appendix.html#ch.b">Chandra, 1983</a>; <a href="appendix.html#am.e">Ammann, 1991</a>).
<p>

 However, the specific immunologic profile that typifies AIDS--a
progressive reduction of <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cells</a> resulting in
persistent <a href="appendix.html#cd4_lymphocytopenia">CD4+ T
lymphocytopenia</a> and profound deficits in cellular immunity--is
extraordinarily rare in the absence of HIV infection or other known
causes of immunosuppression. This was recently demonstrated in several
surveys that sought to determine the frequency of <a href="appendix.html#idiopathic">idiopathic</a> <a
href="appendix.html#cd4_lymphocytopenia">CD4+
T-cell lymphocytopenia</a>  (ICL), which is characterized by <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a>
counts lower than 300 cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood in the
absence of HIV <a href="appendix.html#antibodies">antibodies</a> or conditions or therapies associated with
depressed levels of CD4+ T cells (reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#fa.b">Fauci, 1993b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#la.e">Laurence,
1993</a>).
<p>

 In a CDC survey, only 47 (.02 percent) of 230,179 individuals
diagnosed with AIDS were both HIV-<a href="appendix.html#seronegative">seronegative</a> and had persistently
low CD4+ T cell counts (&lt;300/mm3) in the absence of conditions or
therapies associated with immunosuppression (<a href="appendix.html#sm.b">Smith et al., 1993</a>).
<p>

 In the MACS, 22,643 CD4+ T cell determinations in 2,713
HIV-seronegative homosexual men revealed only one individual with a
CD4+ T cell count persistently lower than 300 cells/mm3, and this
individual was receiving immunosuppressive therapy (<a href="appendix.html#ve.c">Vermund et al.,
1993a</a>). A similar review of another <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> of homosexual and bisexual
men found no case of persistently lowered CD4+ T cell counts among 756
HIV-seronegative men who had no other cause of immunosuppression
(<a href="appendix.html#sm.b">Smith et al., 1993</a>). Analogous results were reported from the San
Francisco Men's Health Study, a population-based cohort recruited in
1984. Among 206 HIV-seronegative heterosexual and 526 HIV-<a href="appendix.html#seronegative">seronegative</a>
homosexual or bisexual men, only one had consistently low <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a>
counts (<a href="appendix.html#sh.a">Sheppard et al., 1993</a>). This individual also had low CD8+ T
cell counts, suggesting that he had general lymphopenia rather than a
selective loss of CD4+ T cells. No AIDS-defining clinical condition
was observed among these HIV-seronegative men.
<p>

 Studies of blood donors, recipients of blood and blood products, and
household and sexual contacts of transfusion recipients also suggest
that persistently low CD4+ T cell counts are extremely rare in the
absence of HIV infection (<a href="appendix.html#al.e">Aledort et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#bu.b">Busch et al.,
1994</a>). Longitudinal studies of injection-drug users have demonstrated
that unexplained <a href="appendix.html#cd4_lymphocytopenia">CD4+ T lymphocytopenia</a> is almost never seen among
HIV-seronegative individuals in this population, despite a high risk
of exposure to <a href="appendix.html#hepatitis">hepatitis B</a>, <a href="appendix.html#cytomegalovirus">cytomegalovirus</a> and other blood-borne
pathogens (<a href="appendix.html#de.b">Des Jarlais et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#we.f">Weiss et al., 1992</a>).
 
<h2><a name="depletion">Mechanisms of CD4+ T Cell Depletion</a></h2>
 
 HIV infects and kills <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T lymphocytes</a> <a href="appendix.html#vitro">in vitro</a>, although
scientists have developed immortalized T-cell lines in order to
propagate HIV in the laboratory (<a href="appendix.html#po.b">Popovic et al., 1984</a>; <a href="appendix.html#za.c">Zagury et al.,
1986</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ga.i">Garry, 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#cl">Clark et al., 1991</a>). Several mechanisms of CD4+ T
cell killing have been observed in lentivirus systems in vitro and may
explain the progressive loss of these cells in HIV-infected
individuals (reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#ga.i">Garry, 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#fa.b">Fauci, 1993a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.a">Pantaleo et al.,
1993a</a>). These mechanisms include disruption of the cell membrane as
HIV buds from the surface (<a href="appendix.html#le.f">Leonard et al., 1988</a>) or the intracellular
accumulation of <a href="appendix.html#heterodisperse">heterodisperse</a> <a href="appendix.html#RNA">RNAs</a> and unintegrated <a href="appendix.html#DNA">DNA</a> (<a href="appendix.html#pa.j">Pauza et
al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ko.d">Koga et al., 1988</a>). Evidence also suggests that
intracellular complexing of CD4 and viral envelope products can result
in cell killing (<a href="appendix.html#ho.f">Hoxie et al., 1986</a>).
<p>

 In addition to these direct mechanisms of CD4+ T cell depletion,
indirect mechanisms may result in the death of uninfected CD4+ T cells
(reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#fa.b">Fauci, 1993a</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.a">Pantaleo et al., 1993a</a>). Uninfected cells
often fuse with infected cells, resulting in giant cells called
syncytia that have been associated with the <a href="appendix.html#cytopathic">cytopathic</a> effect of HIV
in vitro (<a href="appendix.html#so.a">Sodroski et al., 1986</a>; <a href="appendix.html#li.a">Lifson et al., 1986</a>). Uninfected
cells also may be killed when free gp120, the envelope protein of HIV,
binds to their surfaces, marking them for destruction by
<a href="appendix.html#antibodies">antibody</a>-dependent <a href="appendix.html#cellular_cytotoxicity_responses">cellular cytotoxicity responses</a> (<a href="appendix.html#ly">Lyerly et al.,
1987</a>). Other autoimmune phenomena may also contribute to CD4+ T cell
death since HIV envelope proteins share some degree of homology with
certain major histocompatibility complex type II (MHC-II) molecules
(<a href="appendix.html#go.c">Golding et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ko.c">Koenig et al., 1988</a>).
<p>

 A number of investigators have suggested that superantigens, either
encoded by HIV or derived from unrelated agents, may trigger massive
stimulation and expansion of CD4+ T cells, ultimately leading to
depletion or anergy of these cells (<a href="appendix.html#ja.e">Janeway, 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#hu.a">Hugin et al.,
1991</a>). The untimely induction of a form of programmed cell death
called apoptosis has been proposed as an additional mechanism for CD4+
T cell loss in HIV infection (<a href="appendix.html#am.b">Ameisen and Capron, 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#te.c">Terai et al.,
1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#la.f">Laurent-Crawford et al., 1991</a>). Recent reports indicate that
apoptosis occurs to a greater extent in HIV-infected individuals than
in non-infected persons, both in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes
(<a href="appendix.html#fi.a">Finkel et al., 1995</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.e">Pantaleo and Fauci, 1995b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mu.d">Muro-Cacho et al.,
1995</a>).
<p>

 It has also been observed that HIV infects precursors of CD4+ T cells
in the bone marrow and thymus and damages the microenvironment of
these organs necessary for the optimal sustenance and maturation of
progenitor cells (<a href="appendix.html#sc.g">Schnittman et al., 1990b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#st.a">Stanley et al.,
1992</a>). These findings may help explain the lack of regeneration of the
CD4+ T cell pool in patients with AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#fa.b">Fauci, 1993a</a>).
<p>

 Recent studies have demonstrated a substantial viral burden and
active viral replication in both the peripheral blood and lymphoid
tissues even early in HIV infection (<a href="appendix.html#fo">Fox et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#co.m">Coombs et al.,
1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ho.a">Ho et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mi">Michael et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ba.d">Bagnarelli et al., 1992</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#pa.b">Pantaleo et al., 1993b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#em">Embretson et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pi.a">Piatak et al.,
1993</a>). One group has reported that 25 percent of CD4+ T cells in the
lymph nodes of HIV-infected individuals harbor HIV <a href="appendix.html#DNA">DNA</a> early in the
course of disease (<a href="appendix.html#em">Embretson et al., 1993</a>). Other data suggest that
HIV infection is sustained by a dynamic process involving continuous
rounds of new viral infection and the destruction and replacement of
over 1 billion CD4+ T cells per day (<a href="appendix.html#we.b">Wei et al., 1995</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ho.e">Ho et al.,
1995</a>).
<p>

 Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that HIV has a central
role in the <a href="appendix.html#pathogenesis">pathogenesis</a> of AIDS, either directly or indirectly by
triggering a series of <a href="appendix.html#pathogenic">pathogenic</a> events that contribute to
progressive immunosuppression.
 
<h2><a name="koch">Koch's Postulates Fulfilled</a></h2>
 
 Recent developments in HIV research provide some of the strongest
evidence for the causative role of HIV in AIDS and fulfill the
classical postulates for disease causation developed by Henle and Koch
in the 19th century (Koch's postulates reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#ev.a">Evans, 1976</a>, <a href="appendix.html#ev.c">1989a</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#ha.f">Harden, 1992</a>). Koch's postulates have been variously interpreted by
many scientists over the years. One scientist who asserts that HIV
does not cause AIDS has set forth the following interpretation of the
postulates for proving the causal relationship between a microorganism
and a specific disease (<a href="appendix.html#du.a">Duesberg, 1987</a>):
<ul>
  <li> 1)    The microorganism must be found in all cases of the disease.
 
  <li> 2)    It must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture.
 
  <li> 3)    It must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host.
 
  <li> 4)    It must be found in the experimental host so infected.

</ul>

 Recent developments in HIV/AIDS research have shown that HIV fulfills
these criteria as the cause of AIDS.
<p>

 1) The development of <a href="appendix.html#PCR">DNA</a> <a href="appendix.html#PCR">PCR</a> has enabled researchers to document the
    presence of cell-associated <a href="appendix.html#proviral">proviral</a> HIV in virtually all patients
    with AIDS, as well as in individuals in earlier stages of HIV
    disease (<a href="appendix.html#kw">Kwok et al., 1987</a>; <a href="appendix.html#wa.a">Wages et al., 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ba.c">Bagasra et al.,
    1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#br.d">Bruisten et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pe.d">Petru et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ha.d">Hammer et al.,
    1993</a>). <a href="appendix.html#RNA">RNA</a> <a href="appendix.html#PCR">PCR</a> has been used to detect cell-free and/or
    cell-associated viral RNA in patients at all stages of HIV disease
    (<a href="appendix.html#ot">Ottmann et al., 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sc.h">Schnittman et al., 1991</a>; Aoki-Sei, 1992;
    <a href="appendix.html#mi">Michael et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pi.a">Piatak et al., 1993</a>).
<p>

 2) Improvements in co-culture techniques have allowed the isolation of HIV in virtually all AIDS patients, as well as in almost all <a href="appendix.html#seropositive">seropositive</a> individuals with both early- and late-stage disease (<a href="appendix.html#co.m">Coombs et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sc.e">Schnittman et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ho.a">Ho et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ja.a">Jackson et al., 1990</a>).
<p>

 1-4) All four postulates have been fulfilled in three laboratory
workers with no other risk factors who have developed AIDS or severe
immunosuppression after accidental exposure to concentrated HIVIIIB in
the laboratory (<a href="appendix.html#bl.d">Blattner et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#re.a">Reitz et al., 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#co.e">Cohen,
1994c</a>). Two patients were infected in 1985 and one in 1991. All three
have shown marked <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a> depletion, and two have CD4+ T cell
counts that have dropped below 200/mm3 of blood. One of these latter
individuals developed <a href="#PCP">PCP</a>, an AIDS indicator disease, 68 months after
showing evidence of infection and did not receive antiretroviral drugs
until 83 months after the infection. In all three cases, HIVIIIB was
isolated from the infected individual, sequenced, and shown to be the
original infecting strain of virus.
<p>

 In addition, as of Dec. 31, 1994, CDC had received reports of 42
health care workers in the United States with documented,
occupationally acquired HIV infection, of whom 17 have developed AIDS
in the absence of other risk factors (<a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC, 1995a</a>). These individuals
all had evidence of HIV <a href="appendix.html#seroconversion">seroconversion</a> following a discrete
<a href="appendix.html#percutaneous">percutaneous</a> or <a href="appendix.html#mucoutaneous">mucocutaneous</a> exposure to blood, body fluids or other
clinical laboratory specimens containing HIV.
<p>

 The development of AIDS following known HIV seroconversion also has
been repeatedly observed in pediatric and adult blood transfusion
cases (<a href="appendix.html#wa.e">Ward et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#as.e">Ashton et al., 1994</a>), in mother-to-child
transmission (<a href="appendix.html#eu.a">European Collaborative Study, 1991</a>, <a href="appendix.html#eu.b">1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#tu">Turner et al.,
1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#bl.a">Blanche et al., 1994</a>), and in studies of <a href="appendix.html#hemophilia">hemophilia</a>, injection
drug use, and sexual transmission in which the time of seroconversion
can be documented using serial blood samples (<a href="appendix.html#go.b">Goedert et al., 1989</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#re.c">Rezza et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#bi.a">Biggar,
1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#al.a">Alcabes et al., 1993a</a>,<a href="appendix.html#al.b">b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#gi.a">Giesecke et
al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#bu.a">Buchbinder et al., 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.c">Sabin et al., 1993</a>).
<p>

 In many such cases, infection is followed by an acute retroviral
syndrome, which further strengthens the chronological association
between HIV and AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#pe.a">Pedersen et al., 1989</a>, <a href="appendix.html#pe.b">1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sc.a">Schechter et al.,
1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ti">Tindall and Cooper, 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ke.a">Keet et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#si.b">Sinicco et al.,
1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ba.b">Bachmeyer et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#li.d">Lindback et al., 1994</a>).
 
<h2><a name="animal">Evidence From Animal and Laboratory Models</a></h2>
 
 A recent study demonstrated that an HIV variant that causes AIDS in
humans--HIV-2--also causes a similar syndrome when injected into
baboons (<a href="appendix.html#ba.f">Barnett et al., 1994</a>). Over the course of two years,
HIV-2-infected animals exhibited a significant decline in immune
function, as well as lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (which often
afflicts children with AIDS), the development of lesions similar to
those seen in Kaposi's sarcoma, and severe weight loss akin to the
wasting syndrome that occurs in human AIDS patients. Other studies
suggest that pigtailed macaques also develop AIDS-associated diseases
subsequent to HIV-2 infection (<a href="appendix.html#mo.e">Morton et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 Asian monkeys infected with clones of the simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV), a lentivirus closely related to HIV, also develop
AIDS-like syndromes (reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#de.d">Desrosiers, 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#fu.a">Fultz, 1993</a>). In
macaque species, various cloned SIV isolates induce syndromes that
parallel HIV infection and AIDS in humans, including early
<a href="appendix.html#lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</a> and the occurrence of opportunistic infections such as
pulmonary Pneumocystis carinii infection, <a href="appendix.html#cytomegalovirus">cytomegalovirus</a>,
cryptosporidium, <a href="appendix.html#candidiasis">candida</a> and disseminated <a href="appendix.html#MAC">MAC</a> (<a href="appendix.html#le.h">Letvin et al., 1985</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#ke.c">Kestler et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#de.f">Dewhurst et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ko.b">Kodama et al., 1993</a>).<a href="appendix.html#3">[3]</a>
<p>

 In cell culture experiments, molecular clones of HIV are <a href="appendix.html#tropic">tropic</a> for
the same cells as clinical HIV isolates and laboratory strains of the
virus and show the same pattern of cell killing (<a href="appendix.html#ha.l">Hays et al., 1992</a>),
providing further evidence that HIV is responsible for the immune
defects of AIDS. Moreover, in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
mice with human thymus/liver implants, molecular clones of HIV produce
the same patterns of cell killing and <a href="appendix.html#pathogenesis">pathogenesis</a> as seen with
clinical isolates (<a href="appendix.html#bo.b">Bonyhadi et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#al.d">Aldrovandi et al., 1993</a>).
 
<h2><a name="geo">Geographic Considerations</a></h2>
 
 Convincing evidence that HIV causes AIDS also comes from the
geographic correlation between rates of HIV <a href="appendix.html#antibodies">antibody</a> positivity and
incidence of disease. Numerous studies have shown that AIDS is common
only in populations with a high seroprevalence of HIV
antibodies. Conversely, in populations in which HIV antibody
<a href="appendix.html#seroprevalence">seroprevalence</a> is low, AIDS is extremely rare (<a href="appendix.html#un">U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1994</a>).
<p>

 Malawi, a country in southern Africa with 8.2 million inhabitants,
reported 34,167 cases of AIDS to the WHO as of December 1994 (<a href="appendix.html#wh.j">WHO,
1995a</a>). This is the highest case rate in the region. The rate of HIV
seroprevalence in Malawi is also high, as evidenced by serosurveys of
pregnant women and blood donors (<a href="appendix.html#un">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994</a>). In
one survey, approximately 23 percent of more than 6,600 pregnant women
in urban areas were HIV-positive (<a href="appendix.html#da.f">Dallabetta et al.,
1993</a>). Approximately 20 percent of 547 blood donors in a 1990 survey
were HIV-positive (<a href="appendix.html#ko.e">Kool et al., 1990</a>).
<p>

 In contrast, Madagascar, an island country off the southeast coast of
Africa with a population of 11.3 million, reported only nine cases of
AIDS to the WHO through December 1994 (<a href="appendix.html#wh.j">WHO, 1995a</a>). HIV seroprevalence
is extremely low in this country; in recent surveys of 1,629 blood
donors and 1,111 pregnant women, no evidence of HIV infection was
found (<a href="appendix.html#ra.b">Rasamindrakotroka et al., 1991</a>). Yet, other sexually
transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar; a 1989
seroepidemiologic study for syphilis found that 19.5 percent of 12,457
persons tested were infected (<a href="appendix.html#la.b">Latif, 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ha.g">Harms et al., 1994</a>). It is
likely that due to the relative geographic isolation of this island
nation, HIV was introduced late into its population. However, the high
rate of other STDs such as syphilis would predict that HIV will spread
in this country in the future.
<p>

 Similar patterns have been noted in Asia. Thailand reported 13,246
cases of AIDS to the WHO through December 1994, up from only 14 cases
through 1988 (<a href="appendix.html#wh.j">WHO, 1995a</a>). This rise has paralleled the spread of HIV
infection in Thailand. Through 1987, fewer than .05 percent of 200,000
Thais from all risk groups were HIV-<a href="appendix.html#seropositive">seropositive</a> (<a href="appendix.html#we.h">Weniger et al.,
1991</a>). By 1993, 3.7 percent of 55,000 inductees into the Royal Thai
Army tested positive for HIV antibodies, up from 0.5 percent of men
recruited in 1989 (<a href="appendix.html#un">U.S. Bureau of the Census Database, December
1994</a>). Seropositivity among brothel prostitutes in Thailand rose from
3.5 percent in June 1989 to 27.1 percent in June 1993 (<a href="appendix.html#ha.e">Hanenberg et
al., 1994</a>). By mid-1993, an estimated 740,00 people were infected with
HIV in Thailand (<a href="appendix.html#br.c">Brown and Sittitrai, 1994</a>). By the year 2000,
researchers estimate that there may be 1.4 million <a href="appendix.html#cumulative">cumulative</a> HIV
infections and 480,000 AIDS cases in that country (<a href="appendix.html#co.d">Cohen, 1994b</a>).
<p>

 By comparison, South Korea reported only 25 cases of AIDS to the WHO
through Dec. 1994 (<a href="appendix.html#wh.j">WHO, 1995a</a>). In serosurveys in that country
conducted in 1993, HIV seroprevalence was .008 percent among female
prostitutes and .00007 percent among blood donors (<a href="appendix.html#sh.b">Shin et al., 1994</a>).<a href="appendix.html#4">[4]</a>
 
<h2><a name="donor">Evidence From Blood Donor-Recipient Pairs</a></h2>
 
 By the end of 1994, 7,223 <a href="appendix.html#cumulative">cumulative</a> cases of AIDS in the United
States resulting from blood transfusions or the receipt of blood
components or tissue had been reported to the CDC (<a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC,
1995a</a>). Virtually all of these cases can be traced to transfusions
before the screening of the blood supply for HIV commenced in 1985
(<a href="appendix.html#jo.c">Jones et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#se.b">Selik et al., 1993</a>).
<p>

 Compelling evidence supporting a cause-and-effect relationship
between HIV and AIDS has come from studies of transfusion recipients
with AIDS who have received blood from at least one donor with HIV
infection. In the earliest such study (before the discovery of HIV),
seven patients with transfusion-acquired AIDS were shown to have
received a total of 99 units of blood components. At least one donor
to each patient was identified who had AIDS-like symptoms or
immunosuppression (<a href="appendix.html#cu.a">Curran et al., 1984</a>).
<p>

 With the identification of HIV and the development of serologic
assays for the virus in 1984, it became possible to trace infected
donors (<a href="appendix.html#sa.k">Sarngadharan et al., 1984</a>). The first reports of
donor-recipient pairs appeared later that year (<a href="appendix.html#fe.b">Feorino et al., 1984</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#gr.i">Groopman et al., 1984</a>). In one instance, HIV was isolated from both
donor and recipient, and both had developed AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#fe.b">Feorino et al.,
1984</a>); in the other, the recipient was HIV antibody-positive and had
developed AIDS, and the donor had culturable virus in his blood and
was in a group considered to be at high risk for AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#gr.i">Groopman et
al., 1984</a>). Molecular analysis of HIV isolates from these
donor-recipient pairs found that the viruses were slightly different
but much more similar than would be expected by chance alone (<a href="appendix.html#fe.b">Feorino
et al., 1984</a>; <a href="appendix.html#gr.i">Groopman et al., 1984</a>).
<p>

 In a subsequent study of patients with transfusion-acquired AIDS, 28
of 28 individuals had antibodies to HIV, and each had received blood
from an HIV-infected donor (<a href="appendix.html#ja.d">Jaffe et al., 1985b</a>). Similar results were
reported from a set of 18 patients with transfusion-acquired AIDS,
each of whom had received blood from an HIV-infected donor (<a href="appendix.html#mc.b">McDougal
et al., 1985b</a>). Fifteen of the 18 donors in this study had low
<a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+</a>/CD8+ T cell ratios, an immune defect seen in pre-AIDS and AIDS
patients.
<p>

 Another group studied seropositive recipients of blood from 112
donors in whom AIDS later developed and from 31 donors later found to
be positive for HIV antibody. Of 101 seropositive recipients followed
for a median of 55 months after infection, 43 developed AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#wa.e">Ward et
al., 1989</a>).
<p>

 More recently, Australian investigators identified 25 individuals
with transfusion-acquired HIV whose infection could be traced to eight
individuals who donated blood between 1980 and 1985, and subsequently
developed AIDS. By 1992, nine of the 25 HIV-infected blood recipients
had developed AIDS, with progression to AIDS and death more rapid
among the recipients who received blood from the faster-progressing
donors (<a href="appendix.html#as.e">Ashton et al., 1994</a>).
 
<h2><a name="hemo">Impact of HIV Infection on Mortality of Hemophiliacs</a></h2>
 
 As noted above, HIV has been detected in stored blood samples taken
from <a href="appendix.html#hemophilia">hemophiliac</a> patients in the United States as early as 1978
(<a href="appendix.html#ar">Aronson, 1993</a>). By 1984, 55 to 78 percent of U.S. hemophilic patients
were HIV-infected (<a href="appendix.html#le.b">Lederman et al., 1985</a>; <a href="appendix.html#an.a">Andes et al., 1989</a>). A more
recent survey found 46 percent of 9,496 clotting-factor recipients to
be HIV-infected, only 9 of whom had a definitive date of
<a href="appendix.html#seroconversion">seroconversion</a> subsequent to April 1987 (<a href="appendix.html#fr.c">Fricke et al., 1992</a>). By
Dec. 31, 1994, 3,863 individuals in the United States with hemophilia
or <a href="appendix.html#coagulation">coagulation</a> disorders had been diagnosed with AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC, 1995a</a>).
<p>

 The impact of HIV on the life expectancy of hemophiliacs has been
dramatic. In a <a href="appendix.html#retrospective">retrospective</a> study of mortality among 701 hemophilic
patients in the United States, median life expectancy for males with
hemophilia increased from 40.9 years at the beginning of the century
(1900-1920) to a high of 68 years after the introduction of factor
therapy (1971 to 1980). In the era of AIDS (1981 to 1990), life
expectancy declined to 49 years (<a href="appendix.html#jo.b">Jones and Ratnoff, 1991</a>).
<p>

 Another analysis found that the death rate for individuals with
hemophilia A in the United States rose three-fold between the periods
1979-1981 and 1987-1989. Median age at death decreased from 57 years
in 1979-1981 to 40 years in 1987-1989 (<a href="appendix.html#ch.f">Chorba et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 In the United Kingdom, 6,278 males diagnosed with hemophilia were
living during the period 1977-91. During 1979-86, 1,227 were infected
with HIV during transfusion therapy. Among 2,448 individuals with
severe hemophilia, the annual death rate was stable at 8 per 1,000
during 1977-84; during 1985-92 death rates remained at 8 per 1,000
among HIV-seronegative persons with severe hemophilia but rose steeply
in those who were seropositive, reaching 81 per 1,000 in
1991-92. Among 3,830 with mild or moderate hemophilia, the pattern was
similar, with an initial death rate of 4 per 1,000 in 1977-84, rising
to 85 per 1,000 in 1991-92 among seropositive individuals (<a href="appendix.html#da.g">Darby et
al., 1995</a>).
<p>

 In a British <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> of hemophiliacs infected with HIV between 1979
and 1985 and followed prospectively, 50 of 111 patients had died by
the end of 1994, 43 after a diagnosis of AIDS. Only eight of the 61
living patients had <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a> counts above 500/mm3 (<a href="appendix.html#le.d">Lee et al.,
1995</a>).
 
<h2><a name="pediatric">Pediatric AIDS</a></h2>
 
 Newborn infants have no behavioral risk factors, yet 6,209 children
in the United States have developed AIDS through Dec. 31, 1994 (<a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC,
1995a</a>).
<p>

 Studies have consistently shown that of infants born to HIV-infected
mothers, only the 15-40 percent of infants who become HIV-infected
before or during birth go on to develop immunosuppression and AIDS,
while babies who are not HIV-infected do not develop AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#ka.b">Katz, 1989</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#da.a">d'Arminio et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pr">Prober and Gershon, 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#eu.a">European
Collaborative Study, 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#la.a">Lambert et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#li.e">Lindgren et al. 1991</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#an.b">Andiman et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#jo.a">Johnson et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ro.d">Rogers et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#hu.d">Hutto
et al., 1991</a>). Moreover, in those infants who do acquire HIV and
develop AIDS, the rate of disease progression varies directly with the
severity of the disease in the mother at the time of delivery
(<a href="appendix.html#eu.b">European Collaborative Study, 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#bl.a">Blanche et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 Almost all infants born to <a href="appendix.html#seropositive">seropositive</a> mothers have detectable HIV
<a href="appendix.html#antibodies">antibody</a>, which may persist for as long as 15 months. In most cases,
the presence of this antibody does not represent actual infection with
HIV, but is antibody from the HIV-infected mother that diffuses across
the placenta. In a French study of 22 infants born to HIV-infected
mothers, seven babies had antibodies to HIV after one year and all
developed AIDS. In these seven infants, the presence of HIV antibodies
marked actual infection with HIV, not merely antibodies acquired from
the mother. The other 15 children showed a complete loss of maternally
acquired HIV antibodies, were not actually infected, and remained
healthy. Of the babies who developed AIDS, virus was found in four of
four infants tested. HIV was not found in the 15 children who remained
healthy (<a href="appendix.html#do.d">Douard et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ga.g">Gallo, 1991</a>).
<p>

 In the European Collaborative Study, children born to
HIV-seropositive mothers are followed from birth in 10 European
centers. A majority of the mothers have a history of injection drug
use. A recent report showed that none of the 343 children who had lost
maternally transferred HIV antibodies (i.e. they were truly
HIV-negative) had developed AIDS or persistent immune deficiency. In
contrast, among 64 children who were truly HIV-infected (i.e. they
remained HIV antibody positive), 30 percent presented with AIDS within
6 months of age or with oral <a href="appendix.html#candidiasis">candidiasis</a> followed rapidly by the onset
of AIDS. By their first birthday, 17 percent died of HIV-related
diseases (<a href="appendix.html#eu.a">European Collaborative Study, 1991</a>).
<p>

 In a multicenter study in Bangkok, Thailand, 105 children born to
HIV-infected mothers were recently evaluated at 6 months of age
(<a href="appendix.html#ch.c">Chearskul et al., 1994</a>). Of 27 infants determined to be HIV-infected
by <a href="appendix.html#PCR">polymerase chain reaction</a>, 24 developed HIV-related symptoms,
including six who developed CDC-defined AIDS and four who died with
conditions clinically consistent with AIDS. Among 77 exposed but
uninfected infants, no deaths occurred.
<p>

 In a study of 481 infants in Haiti, the survival rate at 18 months
was 41 percent for HIV-infected infants, 84 percent among uninfected
infants born to seropositive women, and 95 percent among infants born
to seronegative women (<a href="appendix.html#bo.c">Boulos et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 Investigators have also reported cases of HIV-infected mothers with
twins <a href="appendix.html#discordant">discordant</a> for HIV-infection in which the HIV-infected child
developed AIDS, while the other child remained clinically and
immunologically normal (<a href="appendix.html#pa.i">Park et al., 1987</a>; <a href="appendix.html#me.b">Menez-Bautista et al.,
1986</a>; <a href="appendix.html#th.b">Thomas et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#yo">Young et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ba.e">Barlow and Mok, 1993</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#gu.a">Guerrero Vazquez et al., 1993</a>).
 
<h2><a name="single">Single Source Outbreak of Pediatric AIDS</a></h2>
 
 Other researchers have used molecular epidemiology to find a single
source of HIV for an outbreak of pediatric AIDS cases in Russia. In
that country between 1988 and 1990, over 250 children were infected
with HIV after exposure to non-sterile needles. By June 1994, 43 of
these children had died of AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#ir">Irova et al., 1993</a>). In a recent
report on 22 of these children from two hospitals, 12 had developed
AIDS. Molecular analysis of HIV isolates from all 22 children showed
the isolates to be very closely related, confirming epidemiological
data that these two outbreaks resulted from a single source: an infant
born to an HIV-infected mother whose husband was infected in central
Africa (<a href="appendix.html#bo.a">Bobkov et al., 1994</a>).
 
<h2><a name="skeptic">Answering the Skeptics: the "Risk-AIDS" or "Behavioral" Hypothesis</a></h2>
 
 Skeptics of the role of HIV in AIDS have espoused a "risk-AIDS" or a
"drug-AIDS" hypothesis (<a href="appendix.html#du.a">Duesberg, 1987</a>-<a href="appendix.html#du.h">1994</a>), asserting at different
times that factors such as promiscuous homosexual activity; repeated
venereal infections and antibiotic treatments; the use of recreational
drugs such as nitrite inhalants, cocaine and heroin; immunosuppressive
medical procedures; and treatment with the drug <a href="appendix.html#AZT">AZT</a> are responsible
for the epidemic of AIDS.
<p>

 Such arguments have been repeatedly contradicted. Compelling evidence
against the risk-AIDS hypothesis has come from <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> studies of
high-risk groups in which all individuals with AIDS-related conditions
are HIV-<a href="appendix.html#antibodies">antibody</a> positive, while matched, HIV-antibody negative
controls do not develop AIDS or immunosuppression, despite engaging in
high-risk behaviors.
<p>

 In a prospectively studied <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> in Vancouver (<a href="appendix.html#sc.b">Schechter et al.,
1993a</a>), 715 homosexual men were followed for a median of 8.6
years. Among 365 HIV-positive individuals, 136 developed AIDS. No
AIDS-defining illnesses occurred among 350 HIV-negative men despite
the fact that these men reported appreciable levels of nitrite use,
other recreational drug use, and frequent receptive anal
intercourse. The average rate of <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a> decline was 50 cells/mm3
per year in the HIV-positive men, while the HIV-negative men showed no
decline. Significantly, the decline of CD4+ T cell counts in
HIV-positive men and the stability of CD4+ T cell counts in
HIV-negative men were apparent whether or not nitrite inhalants were
used. There were 101 AIDS-related deaths among the HIV-<a href="appendix.html#seropositive">seropositive</a>
men, including six unrelated to HIV infection. In the <a href="appendix.html#seronegative">seronegative</a>
group, only two deaths occurred: one heart attack and one suicide. In
this study, lifetime prevalences of risk behaviors were similar in the
136 HIV-seropositive men who developed AIDS and in the 226
HIV-seropositive men who did not develop AIDS: use of nitrite
inhalants, 88 percent in both groups; use of other illicit drugs, 75
percent and 80 percent, respectively; more than 25 percent of sexual
encounters involving receptive anal intercourse, 78 percent and 82
percent, respectively. Among HIV-seronegative men (none of whom
developed AIDS), the lifetime prevalences of these behaviors were
somewhat lower, but substantial: 56 percent, 74 percent and 58
percent, respectively.
<p>

 Similar results were reported from the San Francisco Men's Health
Study, a cohort of single men recruited in San Francisco in 1984
without regard to sexual preference, lifestyle or serostatus (<a href="appendix.html#as.a">Ascher
et al., 1993a</a>). During 96 months of follow-up, 215 cases of AIDS had
occurred among 445 HIV-antibody positive homosexual men, 174 of whom
had died. Among 367 antibody-negative homosexual men and 214
antibody-negative heterosexual men, no AIDS cases and eight deaths
unrelated to AIDS-defining conditions were observed. The authors found
no overall effect of drug consumption, including nitrites, on the
development of Kaposi's sarcoma or other AIDS-defining conditions, nor
an effect of the extent of the participants' drug use on these
conditions. A consistent loss of CD4+ T cells was limited to
HIV-positive subjects, among whom there was no discernible difference
in CD4+ T cell counts related to drug-taking behavior. Among
HIV-seronegative men, moderate or heavy drug users had higher CD4+ T
cell counts than non-users.
<p>

 Observational studies of HIV-infected individuals have found that
drug use does not accelerate progression to AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#ka.a">Kaslow et al., 1989</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#co.a">Coates et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#li.b">Lifson et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ro.a">Robertson et al., 1990</a>). In
a Dutch <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> of HIV-seropositive homosexual men, no significant
differences in sexual behavior or use of cannabis, alcohol, tobacco,
nitrite inhalants, LSD or amphetamines were found between men who
remained <a href="appendix.html#asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> for long periods and those who progressed to
AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#ke.b">Keet et al., 1994</a>). Another study, of five cohorts of homosexual
men for whom dates of seroconversion were well-documented, found no
association between HIV disease progression and history of sexually
transmitted diseases, number of sexual partners, use of <a href="appendix.html#AZT">AZT</a>, alcohol,
tobacco or recreational drugs (<a href="appendix.html#ve.e">Veugelers et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 Similarly, in the San Francisco City Clinic Cohort, recruited in the
late 1970s and early 1980s in conjunction with <a
href="appendix.html#hepatitis">hepatitis B</a> studies, no
consistent differences in exposure to recreational drugs or sexually
transmitted diseases were seen between HIV-infected men who progressed
to AIDS and those who remained healthy (<a href="appendix.html#bu.a">Buchbinder et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 Because many children with AIDS are born to mothers who abuse
recreational drugs (<a href="appendix.html#no.a">Novick and Rubinstein, 1987</a>; <a href="appendix.html#eu.a">European
Collaborative Study, 1991</a>), it has been postulated that the mothers'
drug consumption is responsible for children developing AIDS
(<a href="appendix.html#du.a">Duesberg, 1987</a>-<a href="appendix.html#du.h">1994</a>). This theory is contradicted by numerous reports
of infants with AIDS born to women infected with HIV through
heterosexual contact or transfusions who do not use drugs (<a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC,
1995a</a>). As noted above, the only factor that predicts whether a child
will develop AIDS is whether he or she is infected with HIV, not
maternal drug use.
 
<h2><a name="inject">AIDS and Injection Drug Users</a></h2>
 
 Central to the "risk-AIDS" hypothesis is the notion that chronic
injection drug use causes AIDS (<a href="appendix.html#du.f">Duesberg, 1992</a>), a view that is
contradicted by numerous studies.
<p>

 Although some evidence suggests injection drug use can cause certain
immunologic abnormalities, such as reduction in natural killer (NK)
cell activity (reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#kr.a">Kreek, 1990</a>), the specific immune deficit
that leads to AIDS--a progressive reduction of <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cells</a> resulting
in persistent <a href="appendix.html#cd4_lymphocytopenia">CD4+ T lymphocytopenia</a>--is rare in HIV-seronegative
injection drug users in the absence of other immunosuppressive
conditions (<a href="appendix.html#de.b">Des Jarlais et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#we.f">Weiss et al., 1992</a>).
<p>

 In a survey of 229 HIV-seronegative injection drug users in New York
City, mean CD4+ T cell counts of the group were consistently over
1000/mm3 (<a href="appendix.html#de.b">Des Jarlais et al., 1993</a>). Only two individuals had two CD4+
T cell measurements of fewer than 300/mm3, one of whom died with
cardiac disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma listed as the cause of
death. In a study of 180 HIV-seronegative injection drug users in New
Jersey, the participants' average CD4+ T cell count was 1169/mm3
(<a href="appendix.html#we.f">Weiss et al., 1992</a>). Two of these individuals,
both with <a href="appendix.html#generalized_lymphocytopenia">generalized
lymphocytopenia</a>, had CD4+ T cell counts less than 300/mm3.
<p>

 In the MACS, median CD4+ T cell counts of 63 HIV-seronegative
injection drug users rose from 1061/mm3 to 1124/mm3 in a 15 to 21
month follow-up period (<a href="appendix.html#ma.f">Margolick et al., 1992</a>). In a cross-sectional
study, 11 HIV-seronegative, long-term heroin addicts had mean CD4+ T
cell counts of 1500/mm3, while 11 healthy controls had CD4+ T cell
counts of 820 cells/mm3 (<a href="appendix.html#no.b">Novick et al., 1989</a>).
<p>

 Recent data also refute the notion that a certain lifetime dosage of
injection drugs is sufficient to cause AIDS in HIV-seronegative
individuals. In a Dutch study, investigators compared 86
HIV-seronegative individuals who had been injecting drugs for a mean
of 7.6 years with 70 HIV-seropositive people who had injected drugs
for a mean of 9.1 years. Upon enrollment in 1989, CD4+ T cell counts
were 914/mm3 in the HIV-seronegative group, and 395/mm3 in the
seropositive group. By 1994, there were 25 deaths attributable to
AIDS-defining conditions in the seropositive group; among
HIV-seronegative individuals, eight deaths occurred, none due to
AIDS-defining diseases (<a href="appendix.html#co.c">Cohen, 1994a</a>).
<p>

 Excess mortality among HIV-infected injection drug users as compared
to HIV-seronegative users has also been observed by other
investigators. In a prospective Italian study of 2,431 injection drug
users enrolled in drug treatment programs from 1985 to 1991,
HIV-seropositive individuals were 4.5 times more likely to die than
HIV-seronegative subjects (<a href="appendix.html#za.a">Zaccarelli et al., 1994</a>). No deaths due to
AIDS-defining conditions were seen among 1,661 HIV-seronegative
individuals, 41 of whom died of other conditions, predominantly
overdose, liver disease and accidents. Among 770 individuals who were
HIV-seropositive at study entry or who <a href="appendix.html#seroconversion">seroconverted</a> during the study
period, 89 died of AIDS-related conditions and 52 of other conditions.
<p>

 In HIV-seropositive individuals, a number of investigators have found
no statistical association between injection drug use and decline of
CD4+ T cell counts (<a href="appendix.html#ga.b">Galli et al., 1989</a>, <a href="appendix.html#ga.c">1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sc.i">Schoenbaum et al., 1989</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#ma.f">Margolick et al., 1992</a>, <a href="appendix.html#ma.g">1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mo.b">Montella et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#al.b">Alcabes et al.,
1993b</a>, <a href="appendix.html#al.c">1994</a>; Galai et al., 1995), nor a difference in disease
progression between active versus former users of injection drugs
(<a href="appendix.html#we.a">Weber et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ga.c">Galli et al., 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mo.b">Montella et al., 1992</a>;
Italian Seroconversion Study, 1992).
<p>

 Taken together, these studies suggest that any negative effects of
injection drugs on CD4+ T cell levels are limited and may explain why
many investigators have found that HIV-seropositive injection drug
users have rates of disease progression that are similar to other
HIV-infected individuals (<a href="appendix.html#re.d">Rezza et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mo.b">Montella et al., 1992</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#ga.b">Galli et al., 1989</a>; <a href="appendix.html#se.c">Selwyn et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mu.c">Munoz et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#it">Italian
Seroconversion Study, 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ma.e">MAP Workshop, 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pe.e">Pezzotti et al., 1992</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#ma.f">Margolick et al., 1992</a>, <a href="appendix.html#ma.g">1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#al.b">Alcabes, 1993b</a>, <a href="appendix.html#al.c">1994</a>; Galai et al.,
1995).
 
<h2><a name="sex">Sex and the AIDS Epidemic</a></h2>
 
 It has been asserted "... in America, only promiscuity aided by
aphrodisiac and psychoactive drugs, practiced mostly by 20 to 40
year-old male homosexuals and some heterosexuals, seems to correlate
with AIDS diseases" (<a href="appendix.html#du.e">Duesberg, 1991</a>). Even a cursory review of history
provides evidence to the contrary: such behaviors have existed for
decades --in some cases centuries--and have increased only in a
relative sense in recent years, if at all, whereas AIDS clearly is a
new phenomenon.
<p>

 If promiscuity were a cause of AIDS, one would have expected cases to
have occurred among prostitutes (male or female) prior to
1978. Reports of such cases are lacking, even though prostitution has
been present in most if not all cultures throughout history.
<p>

 In this country, trends in gonorrheal infections suggest that
extramarital sexual activity was extensive in the pre-AIDS era. Cases
of gonorrhea in the United States peaked at approximately 1 million in
1978; between 250,000 and 530,000 cases were reported each year in the
1960s, approximately 250,000 cases each year in the 1950s, and between
175,000 and 380,000 cases annually in the 1940s (<a href="appendix.html#cd.n">CDC, 1987c</a>,
<a href="appendix.html#cd.q">1993b</a>). Despite the frequency of sexually transmitted diseases, only a
handful of documented cases of AIDS in the United States prior to 1978
have been reported.
<p>

 Historians, archaeologists and sociologists have documented extensive
homosexual activity dating from the ancient Greeks to the
well-established homosexual subculture in the United States in the
20th century (<a href="appendix.html#we.c">Weinberg and Williams, 1974</a>; <a href="appendix.html#gi.b">Gilbert, 1980-81</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.g">Saghir
and Robins, 1973</a>; <a href="appendix.html#re.b">Reinisch et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#do.a">Doll et al., 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ka.c">Katz,
1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#fr.e">Friedman and Downey, 1994</a>). Depictions of anal intercourse, both
male and female, can be found in the art and literature of numerous
cultures on all inhabited continents (<a href="appendix.html#re.b">Reinisch et al., 1990</a>). In the
1940s, Kinsey et al. reported that 37 percent of all American males
surveyed had at least some overt homosexual experience to the point of
orgasm between adolescence and old age and that 10 percent of men were
exclusively or predominantly homosexual between the ages of 16 and 55
(<a href="appendix.html#ki">Kinsey et al., 1948</a>). More recent surveys have found that 2 to 5
percent of men are homosexual or bisexual (reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#fr.f">Friedman and
Downey, 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#se.a">Seidman and Rieder, 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#la.d">Laumann, 1994</a>).
<p>

 Many homosexuals had multiple sexual partners in the pre-AIDS era: a
1969 survey found that more than 40 percent of white homosexual males
and one-third of black homosexual males had at least 500 partners in
their lifetime, and an additional one-fourth reported between 100 and
500 partners (<a href="appendix.html#be.b">Bell and Weinberg, 1978</a>). A majority of these men
reported that more than half their partners had been strangers before
the sexual encounters (<a href="appendix.html#be.b">Bell and Weinberg, 1978</a>). Further evidence of
extensive homosexual behavior in the years preceding the AIDS epidemic
comes from reports of numerous cases of rectal gonorrheal and anal
herpes simplex virus infections among men (<a href="appendix.html#je">Jefferiss, 1956</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sc.j">Scott and
Stone, 1966</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pa.h">Pariser and Marino, 1970</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ow">Owen and Hill, 1972</a>; <a href="appendix.html#br.a">British
Cooperative Clinical Group, 1973</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ja.b">Jacobs, 1976</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ju.a">Judson et al., 1977</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#me.d">Merino and Richards, 1977</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mc.e">McMillan and Young, 1978</a>).
 
<h2><a name="drugs">Drug Use in the Pre-AIDS Era</a></h2>
 
 A temporal association between the onset of extensive use of
recreational drugs and the AIDS epidemic is also lacking. The
widespread use of opiates in the United States has existed since the
middle of the 19th century (<a href="appendix.html#co.q">Courtwright, 1982</a>); as many as 313,000
Americans were addicted to opium and morphine prior to 1914. Heroin
use spread throughout the country in the 1920s and 1930s (<a href="appendix.html#co.q">Courtwright,
1982</a>), and the total number of active heroin users peaked at about
626,000 in 1971 (<a href="appendix.html#gr.e">Greene et al., 1975</a>; <a href="appendix.html#fr.d">Friedland, 1989</a>). Opiates were
initially administered by oral or inhalation routes, but by the 1920s
addicts began to inject heroin directly into their veins (<a href="appendix.html#co.q">Courtwright,
1982</a>). In 1940, intravenous use of opiates was seen in 80 percent of
men admitted to a large addiction research center in Kentucky
(<a href="appendix.html#fr.d">Friedland, 1989</a>).
<p>

 While cocaine use increased markedly during the 1970s (<a href="appendix.html#ko.f">Kozel and
Adams, 1986</a>), the use of the drug, frequently with morphine, is
well-documented in the United States since the late 19th century
(<a href="appendix.html#da.d">Dale, 1903</a>; <a href="appendix.html#as.d">Ashley, 1975</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sp">Spotts and Shontz, 1980</a>). For example, a
survey in 1902 reported that only 3 to 8 percent of the cocaine sold
in New York, Boston and other cities went into the practice of
medicine or dentistry (<a href="appendix.html#sp">Spotts and Shontz</a>). After a period of relative
obscurity, cocaine became increasingly popular in the late 1950s and
1960s. Over 70 percent of 1,100 addicts at the addiction research
center in Kentucky in 1968 and 1969 reported use or abuse of cocaine
(<a href="appendix.html#ch.a">Chambers, 1974</a>).
<p>

 The recreational use of nitrite inhalants ("poppers") also predates
the AIDS epidemic. Reports of the widespread use of these drugs by
young men in the 1960s were the impetus for the reinstatement by the
Food and Drug Administration of the prescription requirement for amyl
nitrite in 1968 (<a href="appendix.html#is">Israelstam et al., 1978</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ha.k">Haverkos and Dougherty,
1988</a>). Since the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the use of nitrite
inhalants has declined dramatically among homosexual men, yet the
number of AIDS cases continues to increase (<a href="appendix.html#os.a">Ostrow et al., 1990</a>, <a href="appendix.html#os.b">1993</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#la.c">Lau et al., 1992</a>).
<p>

 In the general population, the number of individuals aged 25 to 44
years reporting current use of marijuana, cocaine, inhalants,
hallucinogens and cigarettes declined between 1974 and 1992, while the
AIDS epidemic worsened (<a href="appendix.html#su">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, 1994</a>).
 
<h2><a name="azt">AZT and AIDS</a></h2>
 
 Although some individuals maintain that treatment with zidovudine
(<a href="appendix.html#AZT">AZT</a>) has compounded the AIDS epidemic (<a href="appendix.html#du.f">Duesberg, 1992</a>), published
reports of both placebo-controlled clinical trials and observational
studies provide data to the contrary.
<p>

 In patients with symptomatic HIV disease, for whom a beneficial
effect is measured in months, AZT appears to slow disease progression
and prolong life, according to double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical studies (reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#sa.j">Sande et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mc.d">McLeod and Hammer,
1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#vo.c">Volberding and Graham, 1994</a>). A clinical trial known as BW 002
compared <a href="appendix.html#AZT">AZT</a> with placebo in 282 patients with AIDS or advanced signs
or symptoms of HIV disease. In this study, which led to the approval
of AZT by the FDA, only one of 145 patients treated with AZT died
compared with 19 of 137 placebo recipients in a six month
period. Opportunistic infections occurred in 24 AZT recipients and 45
placebo recipients. In addition to reducing mortality, AZT was shown
to have reduced the frequency and severity of AIDS-associated
opportunistic infections, improved body weight, prevented
deterioration in Karnofsky performance score, and increased counts of
<a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T lymphocytes</a> in the <a href="appendix.html#peripheral_blood">peripheral blood</a> (<a href="appendix.html#fi.b">Fischl et al., 1987</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#ri.a">Richman et al., 1987)</a>. Continued follow-up in 229 of these patients
showed that the survival benefit of AZT extended to at least 21 months
after the initiation of therapy; survival in the original treatment
group was 57.6 percent at that time, whereas survival among members of
the original placebo group was 51.5 percent at nine months (<a href="appendix.html#ri.b">Richman
and Andrews, 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#fi.c">Fischl et al., 1989</a>).
<p>

 In another placebo-controlled study known as ACTG 016, which enrolled
711 symptomatic HIV-infected patients with <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a> counts between
200 and 500 cells/mm3, those taking AZT were less likely to experience
disease progression than those on placebo during a median study period
of 11 months (<a href="appendix.html#fi.d">Fischl et al., 1990</a>). In this study, no difference in
disease progression was noted among participants who began the trial
with CD4+ T cell counts greater than 500/mm3.
<p>

 A Veteran's Administration study of 338 individuals with early
symptoms of HIV disease and CD4+ T cell counts between 200 and 500
cells/mm3 found that immediate therapy significantly delayed disease
progression compared with deferred therapy, but did not lengthen (or
shorten) survival after an average study period of more than two years
(<a href="appendix.html#ha.c">Hamilton et al., 1992</a>).
<p>

 Among <a href="appendix.html#asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> HIV-infected individuals, several
placebo-controlled clinical trials suggest that AZT can delay disease
progression for 12 to 24 months but ultimately does not increase
survival. Significantly, long-term follow-up of persons participating
in these trials, although not showing prolonged benefit of AZT, has
never indicated that the drug increases disease progression or
mortality (reviewed in <a href="appendix.html#mc.d">McLeod and Hammer, 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.j">Sande et al., 1993</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#vo.c">Volberding and Graham, 1994</a>). The lack of excess AIDS cases and death
in the AZT arms of these large trials effectively rebuts the argument
that AZT causes AIDS.
<p>

 During a 4.5 year follow-up period (mean 2.6 years) of a trial known
as ACTG 019, no differences were seen in overall survival between AZT
and placebo groups among 1,565 asymptomatic patients entering the
study with fewer than 500 CD4+ T cells/mm3 (<a href="appendix.html#vo.b">Volberding et al.,
1994</a>). In that study, AZT was superior to placebo in delaying
progression to AIDS or advanced <a href="appendix.html#ARC">ARC</a> for approximately one year, and a
more prolonged benefit was seen among a subset of patients.
<p>

 The Concorde study in Europe enrolled 1,749 asymptomatic patients
with CD4+ T cell counts less than 500/mm3. In that study, no
statistically significant differences in progression to advanced
disease were observed after three years between individuals taking AZT
immediately and those who deferred AZT therapy or did not take the
drug (<a href="appendix.html#co.h">Concorde Coordinating Committee, 1994</a>). However, the rate of
progression to death, AIDS or severe ARC was slower among the
"immediate" AZT group during the first year of therapy. Although the
Concorde study did not show a significant benefit over time with the
early use of AZT, it clearly demonstrated that AZT was not harmful to
the patients in the "immediate" AZT group as compared to the
"deferred" AZT group.
<p>

 A European-Australian study (EACG 020) of 993 patients with CD4+ T
cell counts greater than 400/mm3 showed no differences between AZT and
placebo arms of the trial during a median study period of 94 weeks,
although AZT did delay progression to certain clinical and
immunological endpoints for up to three years (<a href="appendix.html#co.o">Cooper et al.,
1993</a>). Both this study and the Concorde study reported little severe
AZT-related <a href="appendix.html#hematologic_toxicity">hematologic toxicity</a> at doses of 1,000 mg/day, which is
twice the recommended daily dose in the United States.
<p>

 Uncontrolled studies have found increased survival and/or reduced
frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with HIV disease and
AIDS who were treated with AZT or other anti-retrovirals (<a href="appendix.html#cr">Creagh-Kirk
et al., 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mo.c">Moore et al., 1991a</a>,<a href="appendix.html#mo.d">b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ra.a">Ragni et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sc.d">Schinaia et
al., 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ko.a">Koblin et al., 1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#gr.a">Graham et al., 1991</a>, <a href="appendix.html#gr.c">1992</a>, <a href="appendix.html#gr.b">1993</a>;
<a href="appendix.html#lo.a">Longini, 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ve.a">Vella et al., 1992</a>, <a href="appendix.html#ve.b">1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sa.b">Saah et al., 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ba.a">Bacellar
et al., 1994</a>). In the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, for example,
HIV-infected individuals treated with AZT had significantly reduced
mortality and progression to AIDS for follow-up intervals of six, 12,
18 and 24 months compared to those not taking AZT, even after
adjusting for health status, CD4+ T cell counts and <a href="#PCP">PCP</a> prophylaxis
(<a href="appendix.html#gr.a">Graham et al., 1991</a>, <a href="appendix.html#gr.c">1992</a>).
<p>

 In addition, several <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> studies show that life expectancy of
individuals with AIDS has increased since the use of AZT became common
in 1986-87. Among 362 homosexual men in <a href="appendix.html#hepatitis">hepatitis
B</a> vaccine trial
<a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohorts</a> in New York City, San Francisco and Amsterdam, the time from
<a href="appendix.html#seroconversion">seroconversion</a> to death, a period not influenced by variations in
diagnosing AIDS, has lengthened slightly in recent years (<a href="appendix.html#he">Hessol et
al., 1994</a>). In a Dutch study of 975 males and females with HIV
infection, median survival with AIDS increased from nine months in
1982-1985, to 26 months in 1990 (<a href="appendix.html#bi.b">Bindels et al., 1994</a>). Even taking
into consideration the benefits of improved PCP prophylaxis and
treatment, if AZT were contributing to or causing disease, one would
expect a decrease in survival figures, rather than an increase that
parallels the use of AZT.
<p>

 In an analysis from the San Francisco Men's Health Study, the
investigators note that 169 (73 percent) of 233 AIDS patients had been
treated with AZT at one time or another. However, 90 (53 percent of
the 169) were diagnosed with clinical AIDS before beginning AZT
treatment, and another 51 (30 percent of the 169) had CD4+ T cell
counts lower than 200/mm3 before initiation of AZT treatment (<a href="appendix.html#as.c">Ascher
et al., 1995</a>). The authors conclude, "These data are not consistent
with the hypothesis of a causal role for AZT in AIDS."
 
<h2><a name="anti">Disease Progression Despite Antibodies</a></h2>
 
 It has been argued that HIV cannot cause AIDS because the body
develops HIV-specific <a href="appendix.html#antibodies">antibodies</a> following primary infection
(<a href="appendix.html#du.f">Duesberg, 1992</a>). This reasoning ignores numerous examples of viruses
other than HIV that can be <a href="appendix.html#pathogenic">pathogenic</a> after evidence of immunity
appears (<a href="appendix.html#ol.a">Oldstone, 1989</a>). Primary poliovirus infection is a classic
example of a disease in which high <a href="appendix.html#titer">titers</a> of neutralizing antibodies
develop in all infected individuals, yet a small percentage of
individuals develop subsequent paralysis (<a href="appendix.html#ku">Kurth, 1990</a>). Measles virus
may persist for years in brain cells, eventually causing a chronic
neurological disease despite the presence of antibodies (<a href="appendix.html#ge.b">Gershon,
1990</a>). Viruses such as <a href="appendix.html#cytomegalovirus">cytomegalovirus</a>, herpes simplex and varicella
zoster may be activated after years of latency even in the presence of
abundant antibodies (<a href="appendix.html#we.e">Weiss and Jaffe, 1990</a>). Lentiviruses with long
and variable latency periods, such as visna virus in sheep, cause
central nervous system damage even after the specific production of
neutralizing antibodies (<a href="appendix.html#ha.a">Haase, 1990</a>). Furthermore, it is now
well-documented that HIV can mutate rapidly to circumvent immunologic
control of its replication.


<h2><a name="transfusion">Risks Associated With Transfusion</a></h2>
 
 It has been argued that AIDS among transfusion recipients is due to
underlying diseases that necessitated the transfusion, rather than to
HIV (<a href="appendix.html#du.e">Duesberg, 1991</a>). This theory is contradicted by a report by the
Transfusion Safety Study Group, which compared HIV-negative and
HIV-positive blood recipients who had been given transfusions for
similar diseases. Approximately three years after the transfusion, the
mean <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a> count in 64 HIV-negative recipients was 850/mm3,
while 111 HIV-<a href="appendix.html#seropositive">seropositive</a> individuals had average CD4+ T cell counts
of 375/mm3 (<a href="appendix.html#do.c">Donegan et al., 1990</a>). By 1993, there were 37 cases of
AIDS in the HIV-infected group, but not a single AIDS-defining illness
in the HIV-seronegative transfusion recipients (<a href="appendix.html#co.f">Cohen, 1994d</a>).
<p>

 People have received blood transfusions for decades; however, as
discussed above, AIDS-like symptoms were extraordinarily rare before
the appearance of HIV. Recent surveys have shown that AIDS-like
symptoms remain very rare among transfusion recipients who are
HIV-seronegative and their sexual contacts. In one study of
transfusion safety, no AIDS-defining illnesses were seen among 807
HIV-negative recipients of blood or blood products, or 947 long-term
sexual or household contacts of these individuals (<a href="appendix.html#al.e">Aledort et al.,
1993</a>).
<p>

 In addition, through 1994, the CDC had received reports of 628 cases
of AIDS in individuals whose primary risk factor was sex with an
HIV-infected transfusion recipient (<a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC, 1995a</a>), a finding not
explainable by the "risk-AIDS" hypothesis.
 
<h2><a name="eight">Exposure to Factor VIII</a></h2>
 
 It has also been argued that <a href="appendix.html#cumulative">cumulative</a> exposure to foreign proteins
in <a href="appendix.html#Factor_VIII">Factor VIII</a> concentrates leads to <a href="appendix.html#cd4">CD4+ T cell</a> depletion and AIDS in
<a href="appendix.html#hemophilia">hemophiliacs</a> (<a href="appendix.html#du.f">Duesberg, 1992</a>). This view is contradicted by several
large studies. Among HIV-seronegative patients with hemophilia A
enrolled in the Transfusion Safety Study, no significant differences
in CD4+ T cell counts were noted between 79 patients with no or
minimal factor treatment and 53 patients with the largest amount of
lifetime treatments (cumulative totals in the latter group ranged from
100,000 to 2,000,000 U in two years) (<a href="appendix.html#ha.j">Hassett et al., 1993</a>). Although
the CD4+ T cell counts seen in the low- and high- groups (756/mm3 and
718/mm3, respectively) were 20 to 25 percent lower than controls, such
levels are still within the normal range.
<p>

 In a report from the Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study, the mean
CD4+ T cell counts among 161 HIV-seronegative hemophiliacs was
784/mm3; among 715 HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs, the mean CD4+ T cell
count was 253/mm3 (<a href="appendix.html#le.c">Lederman et al., 1995</a>).
<p>

 In another study, no instances of AIDS-defining illnesses were seen
among 402 HIV-seronegative hemophiliacs treated with factor therapy or
in 83 hemophiliacs who received no treatment subsequent to 1979
(<a href="appendix.html#al.e">Aledort et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#mo.f">Mosely et al., 1993</a>).
<p>

 In a <a href="appendix.html#retrospective">retrospective</a> study of patients with severe hemophilia A, the
rate of CD4+ T cell loss was 31.4 every six months for 41
HIV-seropositive individuals without AIDS and 49.7 every six months
for 14 HIV-seropositive individuals with AIDS. In contrast, among 28
HIV-seronegative individuals, CD4+ T cell counts increased at a rate
of 13.1 cells/six months (<a href="appendix.html#be.a">Becherer et al., 1990</a>).
<p>

 In a study of children and adolescents with hemophilia, the median
CD4+ T cell count of 126 HIV-seronegative individuals was 895/mm3 at
study entry; no individuals had CD4+ T cell counts below 200/mm3. In
contrast, 26 percent of seropositive children had CD4+ T cell counts
of less than 200/mm3; the mean CD4+ T cell count for seropositive
children was 423/mm3 (<a href="appendix.html#ja.f">Jason et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 Although some reports have suggested that high-purity Factor VIII
concentrates are associated with a slower rate of CD4+ T cell decline
in HIV-infected hemophiliacs than products of low and intermediate
purity (<a href="appendix.html#hi.a">Hilgartner et al., 1993</a>; <a href="appendix.html#go.d">Goldsmith et al., 1991</a>; <a href="appendix.html#de.a">de Biasi et
al., 1991</a>), other studies have shown no such benefit (<a href="appendix.html#ma.c">Mannucci et al.,
1992</a>; <a href="appendix.html#gj">Gjerset et al., 1994</a>). In a study of 525 HIV-infected
hemophiliacs, Transfusion Safety Study investigators found that
neither the purity nor the amount of Factor VIII therapy had a
deleterious effect on CD4+ T cell counts (<a href="appendix.html#gj">Gjerset et al.,
1994</a>). Similarly, the Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study found no
association between the <a href="appendix.html#cumulative">cumulative</a> dose of <a href="appendix.html#plasma">plasma</a> concentrate and
incidence of AIDS among 242 HIV-infected hemophiliacs and thus "no
support for cofactor hypotheses involving either <a href="appendix.html#antigen">antigen</a> stimulation
or <a href="appendix.html#inoculum">inoculum</a> size" (<a href="appendix.html#go.b">Goedert et al., 1989</a>).
<p>

 In addition to the evidence from the <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> studies cited above, it
should be noted that 10 to 20 percent of wives and sex partners of
male HIV-positive hemophiliacs in the United States are also
HIV-infected (<a href="appendix.html#pi.c">Pitchenik et al., 1984</a>; <a href="appendix.html#kr.b">Kreiss et al., 1985</a>; <a href="appendix.html#pe.c">Peterman et
al., 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#sm.a">Smiley et al., 1988</a>; <a href="appendix.html#di.b">Dietrich and Boone, 1990</a>; <a href="appendix.html#lu">Lusher et
al., 1991</a>). Through December 1994, the CDC had received reports of 266
cases of AIDS in those who had sex with a person with <a href="appendix.html#hemophilia">hemophilia</a> (<a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC,
1995a</a>). These data cannot be explained by a non-infectious theory of
AIDS <a href="appendix.html#etiology">etiology</a>.
 
<h2><a name="dist">Distribution of AIDS Cases</a></h2>
 
 Certain skeptics maintain that the distribution of AIDS cases casts
doubt on HIV as the cause of the syndrome. They claim infectious
microbes are not gender-specific, yet relatively few people with AIDS
are women (<a href="appendix.html#du.f">Duesberg, 1992</a>).
<p>

 In fact, the distribution of AIDS cases, whether in the United States
or elsewhere in the world, invariably mirrors the prevalence of HIV in
a population (<a href="appendix.html#un">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994</a>). In the United States,
HIV first appeared in populations of homosexual men and injection drug
users, a majority of whom are male (<a href="appendix.html#cu.b">Curran et al., 1988</a>). Because HIV
is spread primarily through sex or by the exchange of HIV-contaminated
needles during injection drug use, it is not surprising that a
majority of U.S. AIDS cases have occurred in men.
<p>

 Increasingly, however, women are becoming HIV-infected, usually
through the exchange of HIV-contaminated needles or sex with an
HIV-infected male (<a href="appendix.html#ve.d">Vermund, 1993b</a>; <a href="appendix.html#cd.s">CDC, 1995a</a>). As the number of
HIV-infected women has risen, so too have the number of female AIDS
cases. In the United States, the proportion of AIDS cases among women
has increased from 7 percent in 1985 to 18 percent in 1994. AIDS is
now the fourth leading cause of death among women aged 25 to 44 in the
United States (<a href="appendix.html#cd.r">CDC, 1994</a>).
<p>

 In Africa, HIV was first recognized in sexually active heterosexuals,
and in some parts of Africa AIDS cases have occurred as frequently in
women as in men (<a href="appendix.html#qu.a">Quinn et al., 1986</a>; <a href="appendix.html#ma.b">Mann, 1992a</a>). In Zambia, for
example, the 29,734 AIDS cases reported to the WHO through October 20,
1993, were equally divided among males and females (<a href="appendix.html#wh.j">WHO, 1995a</a>,<a href="appendix.html#wh.k">b</a>).
 
<h2><a name="africa">AIDS in Africa</a></h2>
 
 One vocal skeptic of the role of HIV in AIDS argues that, in Africa,
AIDS is nothing more than a new name for old diseases (<a href="appendix.html#du.e">Duesberg,
1991</a>). It is true that the diseases that have come to be associated
with AIDS in Africa--wasting, diarrheal diseases and TB--have long
been severe burdens there. However, high rates of mortality from these
diseases, formerly confined to the elderly and malnourished, are now
common among HIV-infected young and middle-aged people (<a href="appendix.html#es.c">Essex,
1994</a>). In a recent study of more than 9,000 individuals in rural
Uganda, people testing positive for HIV <a href="appendix.html#antibodies">antibodies</a> were 60 times as
likely to die during the subsequent two-year observation period as
were otherwise similar persons who tested negative (<a href="appendix.html#mu.b">Mulder et al.,
1994b</a>). Large differences in mortality were also seen between
HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative individuals in another large
Ugandan <a href="appendix.html#cohort">cohort</a> (<a href="appendix.html#se.d">Sewankambo et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 Elsewhere in Africa findings are similar. One study of 1,400 Rwandan
women tested for HIV during pregnancy found that HIV infected women
were 20 times more likely to die in the two years following pregnancy
than their HIV-negative counterparts (<a href="appendix.html#li.c">Lindan et al., 1992</a>). In another
study in Rwanda, 215 HIV-seropositive women and 216 HIV-<a href="appendix.html#seronegative">seronegative</a>
women were followed prospectively for up to four years, during which
time 21 women developed AIDS (WHO definition), all of them in the
HIV-seropositive group. The mortality rate among the HIV-seropositive
women was nine times higher than seen among the HIV-seronegative women
(<a href="appendix.html#le.g">Leroy et al., 1995</a>)
<p>

 In Zaire, investigators found that families in which the mother was
HIV-1 seropositive experienced a five- to 10-fold higher maternal,
paternal and early childhood mortality rate than families in which the
mother was HIV-seronegative (<a href="appendix.html#ry.b">Ryder et al., 1994b</a>). In another study in
Zaire, infants with HIV infection were shown to have an 11-fold
increased risk of death from diarrhea compared with uninfected
children (<a href="appendix.html#th.a">Thea et al., 1993</a>). In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis
in Cote d'Ivoire, HIV-seropositive individuals were 17 times more
likely to die than HIV-seronegative individuals (<a href="appendix.html#ac">Ackah et al., 1995</a>).
<p>

The extraordinary death rates among HIV-infected individuals confirm
that the virus is an important cause of premature mortality in Africa
(<a href="appendix.html#do.b">Dondero and Curran, 1994</a>).


<h2><a name="concl">CONCLUSION</a></h2>
 
 HIV and AIDS have been repeatedly linked in time, place and
population group; the appearance of HIV in the blood supply has
preceded or coincided with the occurrence of AIDS cases in every
country and region where AIDS has been noted. Among individuals
without HIV, AIDS-like symptoms are extraordinarily rare, even in
populations with many AIDS cases. Individuals as different as
homosexual men, elderly transfusion recipients, heterosexual women,
drug-using heterosexual men and infants have all developed AIDS with
only one common denominator: infection with HIV. Laboratory workers
accidentally exposed to highly concentrated HIV and health care
workers exposed to HIV-infected blood have developed immunosuppression
and AIDS with no other risk factor for immune dysfunction. Scientists
have now used <a href="appendix.html#PCR">PCR</a> to find HIV in virtually every patient with AIDS and
to show that HIV is present in large and increasing amounts even in
the pre-AIDS stages of HIV disease. Researchers also have demonstrated
a correlation between the amount of HIV in the body and progression of
the aberrant immunologic processes seen in people with AIDS.
<p>

 Despite this plethora of evidence, the notion that HIV does not cause
AIDS continues to find a wide audience in the popular press, with
potential negative impact on HIV-infected individuals and on public
health efforts to control the epidemic. HIV-infected individuals may
be convinced to forego anti-HIV treatments that can forestall the
onset of the serious infections and malignancies of AIDS (Edelman et
al., 1991). Pregnant HIV-infected women may dismiss the option of
taking <a href="appendix.html#AZT">AZT</a>, which can reduce the likelihood of transmission of HIV
from mother to infant (<a href="appendix.html#co.l">Connor et al., 1994</a>; <a href="appendix.html#bo.d">Boyer et al., 1994</a>).
<p>

 People may be dissuaded from being tested for HIV, thereby missing
the opportunity, early in the course of disease, for counselling as
well as for treatment with drugs to prevent AIDS-related infections
such as <a href="#PCP">PCP</a>. Such prophylactic measures prolong survival and improve
the quality of life of HIV-infected individuals (<a href="appendix.html#cd.p">CDC, 1992b</a>).
<p>

 Most troubling is the prospect that individuals will discount the
threat of HIV and continue to engage in risky sexual behavior and
needle sharing. If public health messages on AIDS prevention are
diluted by the misconception that HIV is not responsible for AIDS,
otherwise preventable cases of HIV infection and AIDS may occur,
adding to the global tragedy of the epidemic.<p>
