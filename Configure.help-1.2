Kernel math emulation
CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION
  Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point
  operations) if you don't have one. 486DX and Pentium processors have
  a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added
  a 487DX or 387, respectively.  (The messages during boot time can
  give you some hints here ["man dmesg"]) Everyone needs either a
  coprocessor or this emulation. If you enable this emulation even
  though you have a coprocessor, the coprocessor will be used
  nevertheless. (This behavior can be changed with the kernel command
  line option "no387", which comes handy if your coprocessor is
  broken. See the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin)
  about how to pass options to the kernel. The lilo procedure is also
  explained in the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.) This means that it is a good
  idea to say Y here if you intend to use this kernel on different
  machines. More information about the internals of Linux math
  coprocessor emulation can be found in arch/i386/math-emu/README. If
  you are not sure, say Y; apart from resulting in a 45kB bigger
  kernel, it won't hurt.

Normal floppy disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD
  If you want to use your floppy disk drive(s) under Linux, say
  Y. Information about this driver, especially important for IBM
  Thinkpad users, is contained in drivers/block/README.fd.
  
Normal (MFM/RLL) disk and IDE disk/cdrom support
CONFIG_ST506   		           
  This is the regular, non-SCSI harddisk support. Pretty much everyone
  will want to say Y here, except if they configure a diskless machine
  which mounts all files over the network using NFS (rare; if you are
  planning to do this, have a look at the package
  /pub/Linux/system/Linux-boot/netboot-nfs.tar.gz, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu, extract with "tar xzvf
  filename") or if they exclusively use SCSI drives and no IDE/ATAPI
  CDROMs (ATAPI = AT Attachment Packet Interface is a new protocol
  currently used for controlling CDROM and tape drives, similar to the
  SCSI protocol. Some newer CDROM drives such as NEC 260 and MITSUMI
  triple/quad speed drives use it, but most MITSUMI CDROM drives
  don't).  Useful information about how to use large (>504MB) IDE
  harddrives is contained in drivers/block/README.ide. To fine-tune
  the parameters of your IDE drive for improved performance, you might
  want to have a look at the hdparm package in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/diskdrives/
	
Use old (reliable) disk-only driver for primary i/f
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD
  As you might have guessed, there are now two drivers for IDE
  harddrives around: the old reliable one and the new improved
  one. The new driver can also handle IDE/ATAPI CDROM drives (ATAPI =
  AT Attachment Packet Interface is a new protocol currently used for
  controlling CDROM and tape drives, similar to the SCSI
  protocol. Some newer CDROM drives such as NEC 260 and MITSUMI
  triple/quad speed drives use it, but most MITSUMI CDROM drives
  don't). The old driver supports up to two hard drives, while the new
  one can deal with any mix of up to four hard drives and IDE/ATAPI
  CDROMs, two per IDE interface (one "master" and one "slave"; the
  first is always the master). Using the old driver makes sense if you
  have older MFM/RLL/ESDI drives, since it is smaller and these drives
  don't benefit from the additional features of the new driver. If you
  have two IDE interfaces (=controllers), you can use the old driver
  on the first and the new one on the second, if you like. In that
  case (or if you have just one interface and don't want to use the
  new driver at all) you would say Y here, thereby enlarging your
  kernel by about 4 kB. If you want to use the new driver exclusively,
  say N.  Useful information about how to use large (>504MB) IDE
  harddrives is contained in drivers/block/README.ide. If unsure, say
  N.

Use new IDE driver for primary/secondary i/f 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE 
  This will use the new and improved IDE driver for the specified IDE
  interface (=controller).  You can use up to 4 IDE harddisks and
  IDE/ATAPI CDROMs, 2 per interface. (ATAPI = AT Attachment Packet
  Interface is a new protocol currently used for controlling CDROM and
  tape drives, similar to the SCSI protocol. Some newer CDROM drives
  such as NEC 260 and MITSUMI triple/quad speed drives use it, but
  most MITSUMI CDROM drives don't.) If you have just one IDE harddisk
  and no IDE/ATAPI CDROM drive and you intend to use the old IDE
  driver on the primary interface, say N here. Everybody else says
  Y. This driver enlarges your kernel by about 8kB. Useful information
  about how to use large (>504MB) IDE harddrives is contained in
  drivers/block/README.ide.

Include support for IDE/ATAPI CDROMs
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD
  If you have a CDROM drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y. (ATAPI =
  AT Attachment Packet Interface is a new protocol currently used for
  controlling CDROM and tape drives, similar to the SCSI protocol and
  derived from IDE=ATA. Some newer CDROM drives such as NEC 260 and
  MITSUMI triple/quad speed drives use it, but most MITSUMI CDROM
  drives don't.) If this is your only CDROM drive, you can say N to
  all other CDROM options appearing later, but make sure to say Y to
  the ISO9660 filesystem and read the CDROM-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note
  that older version of the linux boot loader lilo cannot properly
  deal with IDE/ATAPI CDROMs; install lilo 16 or higher, available
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Linux-boot/lilo.

XT harddisk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_XD
  Very old 8 bit hard disk controllers used in the IBM XT
  computer. Pretty unlikely that you have this: say N.

Networking support
CONFIG_NET
  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y
  here. The reason is that some programs need it even if you configure
  a stand-alone machine that won't be connected to any other computer.
  If you have recently upgraded from an older kernel, you should
  consider updating your networking tools too; read net/inet/README for
  details. 

Limit memory to low 16MB
CONFIG_MAX_16M
  This is for some buggy motherboards which cannot properly deal with
  the memory above 16MB. If you have more than 16MB of RAM and
  experience weird problems, you might want to try Y, everyone else
  says N. Note for machines with more that 64MB: in order for the
  kernel to be able to use the memory above 64MB, pass the command
  line option "mem=XXXM" (where XXX is the memory size in megabytes)
  to your kernel. See the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or
  loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel. The lilo procedure
  is also explained in the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  You also need
  at least 512kB of RAM cache if you have more than 64MB or RAM. Some
  other things to do when experiencing seemingly random, "weird"
  problems: 1) passing the "no-hlt" option to the kernel 2) passing
  the "no-387" option to the kernel 3) passing the "mem=4M" option to
  the kernel (will disable all but the first 4M of RAM) 4) disabling
  the cache from your BIOS settings 5) exchanging RAM chips 6)
  exchanging the motherboard 7) committing suicide.

PCI bios support
CONFIG_PCI
  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, Microchannel or VESA. If
  you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N. Note: some old PCI motherboards
  have BIOS bugs and may crash if this is enabled (but they run fine
  without this option). The PCI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO, contains
  valuable information about which PCI hardware works under Linux and
  which doesn't.  Information regarding the buggy PCTech RZ 1000 IDE
  harddrive controller which is used in some PCI systems is on the WWW
  at http://www.powerquest.com/hardware.html. (To browse the WWW, you
  need to have access to a machine on the Internet that has one of the
  programs lynx, netscape or Mosaic).

PCI bridge optimization (experimental)
CONFIG_PCI_OPTIMIZE
  This can improve access times for some hardware devices under
  certain BIOSes if your computer uses a PCI bussystem. This is
  experimental, so it's probably best to first say N here, compile a
  working kernel, and then come back later and try to enable this and
  see what it does to you.

System V IPC
CONFIG_SYSVIPC
  InterProcessCommunication is a suite of library functions and system
  calls which let processes (= running programs) synchronize and
  exchange information. It is generally considered to be a good thing,
  and some programs won't run unless you enable this. In particular,
  if you want to run the DOS emulator dosemu under Linux (read the
  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO), you'll need to say Y here. You
  can find documentation about IPC in ipc.info, which is contained in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/man/info.tar.gz (extract with "tar
  xzvf filename"). These docs are in the info format which is used to
  document GNU software and can be read from within emacs ("Ctrl-h i")
  or with the program info ("man info"). Enabling this option enlarges
  your kernel by about 7kB. Just say Y.

Kernel support for ELF binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF
  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
  executables used across different architectures and operating
  systems. This option will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries and
  enlarge it by about 2kB. ELF support under Linux is quickly
  replacing the traditional Linux a.out format because it is portable
  (this does *not* mean that you will be able to run executables from
  different architectures or operating systems!) and makes building
  run-time libraries very easy. Many new executables are distributed
  solely in ELF format. You definitely want to say Y here. Information
  about ELF is on the WWW at
  http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/users/barlow/elf-howto.html (To browse the
  WWW, you need to have access to a machine on the Internet that has
  one of the programs lynx, netscape or Mosaic). If you want to
  compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say N here and
  read README.modules.

Use -m486 flag for 486-specific optimizations
CONFIG_M486
  If you have a 486 as opposed to a 386 or Pentium CPU, say Y here:
  things will be slightly faster. However, it is not required: the
  kernel will run on all CPUs with and without this option. If you are
  not sure, say Y; apart from enlarging your kernel by about 6 kB, it
  won't hurt.

Set version information on all symbols for modules
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
  Kernel modules are pieces of code which can be inserted in or
  removed from the running kernel, using the programs insmod and
  rmmod. This is described in the file README.modules. Usually,
  modules have to be recompiled whenever you switch to a new
  kernel. Enabling this option allows you to keep using the same
  modules even after compiling a new kernel; this requires the program
  modprobe. All the software needed for module support is in the
  modules package in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel, available via
  ftp (user: anonymous). NOTE: if you say Y here but don't have the
  program genksyms (which is also contained in the above mentioned
  modules package), the building of your kernel will fail. Therefore,
  N is a safe bet.

TCP/IP networking
CONFIG_INET
  These are the protocols used on the Internet and on most local
  Ethernets. The safest is to say Y here (which will enlarge your
  kernel by about 35 kB), since some programs (e.g. the X window
  system) use TCP/IP even if your machine is not connected to any
  other computer. You will get the so-called loopback device which
  allows you to ping yourself (great fun, that!). This option is also
  necessary if you want to use the full power of term (term is a
  program which gives you almost full Internet connectivity if you
  have a regular dial up shell account on some Internet connected Unix
  computer. Read the Term-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  on sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO).  Short answer: say Y.

IP forwarding/gatewaying
CONFIG_IP_FORWARD
  People who want to use their Linux box as the router for a local
  network (i.e. the computer responsible for distributing Internet
  traffic to and from the machines in the local network and the
  subnetworks) should say Y here (thereby enlarging their kernel by
  about 5 kB). Note that in this case, you possibly have two ethernet
  devices in your computer: one for the "outside world" and one for
  your local net. The kernel is not able to recognize both at boot
  time without help; for details read the
  Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.  If your box is
  connected to two networks, it may still make sense to say N here,
  namely if you want to turn your box into a firewall protecting a
  local network from the internet. The Firewall-HOWTO tells you how to
  do this. If your setup is more complex, say you are connected to
  three networks and you want to act as a firewall between two of them
  and route traffic for the others, you need to say Y here and enable
  IP firewalling below. You should say Y here also if you want to
  configure your box as a SLIP (the protocol for sending internet
  traffic over telephone lines) or PPP (a better SLIP) server for
  other people to dial into and your box is connected to a local
  network at the same time. You would then most likely use proxy-ARP
  (Address Resolution Protocol), explained in the Proxy-Arp mini howto
  on sunsite in /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini. If unsure, say N.

IP multicasting
CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
  This is code for addressing several networked computers at once,
  enlarging your kernel by about 2 kB. Some versions of gated, the
  program which constantly updates a networked computer's routing
  tables, require that this option be compiled in. You also need
  multicasting if you intend to participate in the MBONE, a high
  bandwidth network on top of the internet which carries audio and
  video broadcasts. More information about the MBONE is on the WWW at
  http://www.best.com/~prince/techinfo/mbone.html (to browse the WWW,
  you need to have access to a machine on the Internet that has one of
  the programs lynx, netscape or Mosaic). Information about the
  multicast capabilities of the various network cards is contained in
  drivers/net/README.multicast. For most people, it's safe to say N.

IP firewalling
CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL
  A firewall is a computer which protects a local network from the
  rest of the internet: all traffic to and from computers on the local
  net is inspected by the firewall first. If you want to enlarge your
  kernel by about 2kB and configure your Linux box as a firewall for a
  local network, say Y here. You will need to read the FIREWALL-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Also, you will have to use
  the ipfw tool from the net-tools package, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from
  ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/Linux/Networking/PROGRAMS/NetTools, or
  preferably ipfwadm from ftp.xos.nl:/pub/linux/ipfwadm/. These
  programs allows selective blocking of internet traffic based on
  type, origin and destination. Note that IP firewalling is broken in
  kernel version 1.2.0 -- use 1.2.1 or higher. Chances are that you
  don't want this, so say N.

IP accounting
CONFIG_IP_ACCT
  This keeps track of your IP network traffic and produces some
  statistics. Usually, you only want to say Y here if your box will be
  a router or a firewall for some local network, in which case you
  naturally should have said Y to IP forwarding/gatewaying resp. IP
  firewalling. The data is accessible with "cat /proc/net/ip_acct", so
  you want to say Y to the /proc filesystem below, if you say Y
  here. To specify what exactly should be recorded, you need the tool
  ipfw from the net-tools package, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from
  ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/Linux/Networking/PROGRAMS/NetTools.  Also, you
  might want to have a look at the net-acct package, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/management. Most people
  say N, however.

PC/TCP compatibility mode
CONFIG_INET_PCTCP
  If you have been having difficulties telneting to your Linux machine
  from a DOS system that uses (broken) PC/TCP networking software, try
  enabling this option.  Everyone else says N.

Reverse ARP
CONFIG_INET_RARP
  Since you asked: if there are diskless machines on your network that
  know their hardware ethernet address but don't know their IP
  addresses upon startup, they send out a Reverse
  Address Resolution Protocol request to find out their own IP
  addresses. If you want your Linux box to be able to *answer* such
  requests, say Y here; you'd use the program rarp ("man rarp").  If
  you don't understand a word, say N and rest in peace.

Assume subnets are local
CONFIG_INET_SNARL
  Say Y if you are on a subnetted network with all machines connected
  by Ethernet segments only, as this option optimizes network access
  for this special case. If there are other connections, e.g. SLIP
  links, between machines of your IP network, say N.  If in doubt, say
  Y.

Disable NAGLE algorithm (normally enabled)
CONFIG_TCP_NAGLE_OFF
  The NAGLE algorithm works by requiring an acknowledgment before
  sending small IP frames (= packets).  This keeps tiny packets from
  telnet and rlogin from congesting Wide Area Networks.  You may wish
  to disable it if you run your X-server from across the network, or
  if multiple byte key sequences are delayed. Most people strongly
  recommend to say N here, though, thereby leaving NAGLE enabled.

IP: Allow large windows (not recommend if <16Mb of memory)
CONFIG_SKB_LARGE
  This option can speed up network performance. It works by increasing
  the size of socket buffers, thereby reducing overhead but increasing
  memory usage. Say N if you have less than 16Mb of RAM, otherwise Y.
  Note for machines with more that 64MB: in order for the kernel to be
  able to use the memory above 64MB, pass the command line option
  "mem=XXXM" (where XXX is the memory size in megabytes) to your
  kernel. See the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin)
  about how to pass options to the kernel. The lilo procedure is also
  explained in the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. You also need at least 512kB
  of RAM cache if you have more than 64MB or RAM.

The IPX protocol
CONFIG_IPX
  This is support for the Novell networking protocol, IPX, commonly
  used for local networks of Windows machines. You need it if you want
  to access Novell Netware file or print servers using the Linux
  Novell client ncpfs (available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/) or from within the
  Linux DOS emulator dosemu (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO). The IPX driver would enlarge
  your kernel by about 5 kB. Unless you want to integrate your Linux
  box with a local Novell network, say N.

Appletalk DDP
CONFIG_ATALK
  Appletalk is the way Apple computers speak to each other on an
  Ethernet (Apple calls it EtherTalk) network. If your linux box is
  connected to such a network and you want to join the conversation,
  say Y. You will need to use the netatalk package so that your Linux
  box can act as a print and file server for macs as well as access
  appletalk printers. Check out
  http://artoo.hitchcock.org/~flowerpt/projects/linux-netatalk/ on the
  WWW for details (to browse the WWW, you need to have access to a
  machine on the Internet that has one of the programs lynx, netscape
  or Mosaic). The NET-2-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO contains valuable information
  as well.  I hear that the GNU boycott of Apple is over, so even
  politically correct people are allowed to say Y here.

Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2
CONFIG_AX25
  This is the protocol used for computer communication over Radio. It
  is either used by itself for point-to-point links, or to carry
  other protocols such as tcp/ip and netrom. To use it, you need a
  device that connects your Linux box to your amateur radio and that
  is supported by Linux. Currently, there are two of them: the Ottawa
  PI cards (to enable support for this card, you'll have to answer Y
  to the question about ALPHA test drivers, below) and the Z8530 SCC
  cards.  In order to use AX.25, you need to get a set of supporting
  software tools via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunacm.swan.ac.uk:/pub/misc/Linux/Radio/. A comprehensive listing of
  all the software for Linux amateur radio users as well as
  information about how to configure an AX.25 port is contained in the
  HAM-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. AX.25 support is actively
  being developed, so you might want to get the very latest 1.3
  kernel if you intend to use this.

SCSI support?
CONFIG_SCSI
  If you want to use an SCSI harddisk, SCSI tapedrive, SCSI CDROM or
  any other SCSI device under Linux, say Y and make sure that you know
  the name of your SCSI host adaptor (the card inside your computer
  that "speaks" the SCSI protocol), because you will be asked for
  it. And read the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. 

SCSI disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD
  If you want to use an SCSI harddisk under Linux, say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. This is NOT for SCSI
  CDROMs. 

SCSI tape support
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_ST
  If you want to use an SCSI tapedrive under Linux, say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO and drivers/scsi/README.st in
  the kernel source. This is NOT for SCSI CDROMs. Note that there have
  been reports that the Linux kernels 1.2.0 - 1.2.11 have some
  problems with their SCSI tape drivers: sometimes you can't read what
  you wrote, which makes the whole thingy kind of useless. 

SCSI CDROM support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR
  If you want to use an SCSI CDROM under Linux, say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO and the CDROM-HOWTO from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Also make sure to enable the
  ISO9660 filesystem later. 

SCSI generic support
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG
  If you want to use SCSI scanners, synthesizers or CD-writers or just
  about anything having "SCSI" in its name, say Y here. Those won't be
  supported by the kernel directly, so you need some additional
  software which knows how to talk to these things using the SCSI
  protocol. Chances are that you'll have to write that software
  yourself, so have a look at the SCSI-HOWTO and at the
  SCSI-Programming-HOWTO, both available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.

Probe all LUNs on each SCSI device
CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN
  If you have an SCSI device that supports more than one LUN (Logical
  Unit Number), e.g. a CD jukebox, you should say Y here so that all
  will be found by the SCSI driver. An SCSI device with multiple LUNs
  acts logically like multiple SCSI devices. The vast majority of SCSI
  devices have only one LUN, and so most people can say N here.

Adaptec AHA152X support
CONFIG_SCSI_AHA152X
  This is support for an SCSI host adaptor. It is explained in section
  3.3 of the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If it doesn't work out of the
  box, you may have to change some settings in drivers/scsi/aha152x.h.

Adaptec AHA1542 support
CONFIG_SCSI_AHA1542
  This is support for an SCSI host adaptor. It is explained in section
  3.4 of the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If it doesn't work out of
  the box, you may have to change some settings in
  drivers/scsi/aha1542.h.  If you want to compile this as a module 
  ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want), say N here and read README.modules.
 
Adaptec AHA1740 support
CONFIG_SCSI_AHA1740
  This is support for an SCSI host adaptor. It is explained in section
  3.5 of the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If it doesn't work out of
  the box, you may have to change some settings in
  drivers/scsi/aha1740.h.

Adaptec AHA274X/284X support
CONFIG_SCSI_AHA274X
  Information about this SCSI host adaptor is contained in
  drivers/scsi/README.aha274x and in the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) at sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If
  it doesn't work out of the box, you may have to change some settings
  in drivers/scsi/aha274x.h.

BusLogic SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_BUSLOGIC
  This is support for the BusLogic family of SCSI host adaptors.  If
  it doesn't work out of the box, you may have to change some settings
  in drivers/scsi/buslogic.h. Please read the SCSI-HOWTO, available
  via ftp (user: anonymous) at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. 

EATA-DMA (DPT,NEC&ATT for ISA,EISA,PCI) support
CONFIG_SCSI_EATA_DMA
  This is support for an SCSI host adaptor. Please read the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If it doesn't work out of the
  box, you may have to change some settings in

CONFIG_SCSI_7000FASST
  This driver supports the Western Digital 7000 SCSI host adaptor.
  Some information is in the source: drivers/scsi/wd7000.c.

Network device support?
CONFIG_NETDEVICES
  You can say N here in case you don't intend to connect to any other
  computer at all or all your connections will be either via UUCP
  (UUCP is a protocol to forward mail and news between unix hosts over
  telephone lines; read the UUCP-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO) or dialing up a
  shell account or a BBS, even using term (term is a program which
  gives you almost full Internet connectivity if you have a regular
  dial up shell account on some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
  the Term-HOWTO).  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a
  network card that you want to use under linux (make sure you know
  its name because you will be asked for it and read the
  Ethernet-HOWTO; also, if you plan to use more than one network card
  under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini) or if you want to use
  SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol is the protocol used to send
  Internet traffic over telephone lines or nullmodem cables) or CSLIP
  (compressed SLIP) or PPP (better and newer variant of SLIP) or PLIP
  (Parallel Line Internet Protocol is mainly used to create a mini
  network by connecting the parallel ports of two local machines) or
  AX.25/KISS (protocol for sending internet traffic over radio links).
  Make sure to read the NET-2-HOWTO.  Eventually, you will have to
  read Olaf Kirch's excellent book "Network Administrator's Guide", to
  be found in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP.  If unsure, say Y.

Dummy net driver support
CONFIG_DUMMY
  This is essentially a loopback device (i.e. traffic you send to this
  device is immediately returned back to you) with a configurable IP
  address different from the usual 127.0.0.1. It is most commonly used
  in order to make your currently inactive SLIP address seem like a
  real address for local programs. If you use SLIP or PPP, you might
  want to enable it. Read about it in the Network Administrator's
  Guide, available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP. Since this thing comes often
  handy, the default is Y. It won't enlarge your kernel either. What a
  deal!  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say N here and read README.modules. If you want to use more than one
  dummy device at a time, you need to compile it as a module.
  
SLIP (serial line) support
CONFIG_SLIP
  Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
  connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
  other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
  SLIP/CSLIP server for other people to dial in.  SLIP (Serial Line
  Internet Protocol) is the protocol used to send Internet traffic
  over telephone lines or serial cables (also known as
  nullmodems). Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in
  order for you to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator
  called SLiRP around (available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/) which allows you
  to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If you plan to
  use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The NET-2-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO, explains how to configure
  SLIP. Note that you don't need SLIP support if you just want to run
  term (term is a program which gives you almost full Internet
  connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on some
  Internet connected Unix computer. Read the Term-HOWTO, available via
  ftp (user: anonymous) on
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO). SLIP support will enlarge
  your kernel by about 4kB. If unsure, say N.  If you want to compile
  this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from
  the running kernel whenever you want), say N here and read
  README.modules.
  
CSLIP compressed headers
CONFIG_SLIP_COMPRESSED
  This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the
  TCP/IP headers (not on the data itself), but it has to be supported
  on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and say
  Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If you
  plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/)
  which allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell
  connection, you definitely want to say Y here. The NET-2-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO, explains how to configure
  CSLIP. This won't enlarge your kernel.

16 channels instead of 4
SL_SLIP_LOTS
  This is for configuring your Linux Box as a dial-in SLIP server. It
  allows for 16 simultaneous connections.  Enlarges your kernel by
  about 4 kB. If you intend to do this, you should read the Network
  Administrator's Guide, available via ftp (user: anonymous) at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP.

PPP (point-to-point) support
CONFIG_PPP
  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP. It serves
  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (or other
  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
  otherwise you can't use it (not quite true any more: the free
  program SLiRP can emulate a PPP line if you just have a regular dial
  up shell account on some UNIX computer; get it via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/).
  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd, as described
  in the PPP-HOWTO, available from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note that you don't need this
  option if you just want to run term (term is a program which gives
  you almost full Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up
  shell account on some Internet connected UNIX computer. Read the
  Term-HOWTO). The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16kB. This
  driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). If you
  want to compile it as a module, say N here and read
  README.modules. If unsure, say N.

16 channels instead of 4 
CONFIG_PPP_LOTS
  Saying Y here will allow you to have up to 16 PPP connections
  running in parallel. This is mainly useful if you intend your linux
  box to act as a dial-in PPP server. Most people can say N.

PLIP (parallel port) support
CONFIG_PLIP
  PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is mainly used to create a
  mini network consisting of two (or, rarely, more) local
  machines. The parallel ports (the connectors at the computers with
  25 holes) are connected using a "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink"
  cable which can transmit 4 bits at a time or using special PLIP
  cables, to be used on bidirectional parallel ports only, which can
  transmit 8 bits at a time (you can find the wiring of these cables
  in drivers/net/README?.plip). The cables can be up to 15m long. This
  works also if one of the machines runs DOS and has some PLIP
  software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet driver
  (http://sunsite.cnam.fr/packages/Telnet/PC/msdos/misc/pktdrvr.txt)
  and NCSA's telnet.  If you want to use this, say Y and read the PLIP
  mini-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini as well as the
  NET-2-HOWTO in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note that the
  PLIP protocol was changed and this PLIP driver won't work together
  with the PLIP support in Linux versions 1.0.x.  This option enlarges
  your kernel by about 8kB. If you want to compile this as a module (
  = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want), say N here and read README.modules. If you
  intend to use PLIP in addition to a parallel printer, you have the
  following options: 1) If both PLIP and the printer are to use the
  same parallel port (presumably because you have just one), then you
  should compile both PLIP and the printer support as modules, always
  loading the one you need and then removing it again. 2) If PLIP and
  the printer are to use different ports, change the macro LP_NO to 2
  or 1 in drivers/char/lp.c and say Y to both the parallel printer
  support and PLIP.

Do you want to be offered ALPHA test drivers
CONFIG_NET_ALPHA
  ALPHA means that they might be unstable and buggy; it has nothing to
  do with the computer architecture of the same name. If you don't
  have a network card in your computer, say N; otherwise say Y,
  because in most circumstances buggy support for your hardware is
  still better than none at all (in particular, it enables you to test
  and improve the drivers). Note that the answer to this question
  doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause this
  configure script to present you with less choices. If you plan to
  use more than one network card under linux, read the
  Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available via ftp (user anonymous)
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

  one network card under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO,
  available from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini. Note that
  the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel:
  saying N will just cause this configure script to skip all the
  questions about Western Digital cards. If you say Y, you will be
  asked for your specific card in the following questions. If you plan
  to use more than one network card under linux, read the
  Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available via ftp (user anonymous)
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note that the answer to
  this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just
  cause this configure script to skip all the questions about 3COM
  cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the
  following questions. If you plan to use more than one network card
  under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

  bussystem (that's the way the components of the card talk to each
  other) is ISA (as opposed to EISA, VLB or PCI), say Y. Make sure you
  know the name of your card. Read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available via
  ftp (user: anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If
  unsure, say Y.  Note that the answer to this question doesn't
  directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause this configure
  script to skip all the remaining ISA network card questions.  If you
  say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the following
  questions.  If you plan to use more than one network card under
  linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

Arcnet support
CONFIG_ARCNET
  If you have a network card of this type, say Y and check out the
  beautiful poetry in drivers/net/README.arcnet in the kernel
  source. If you get this driver to work or not, either way, send mail
  to the author. You might also want to have a look at the

  Y. Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause this configure script to skip all
  the questions about this class of network cards. If you say Y, you
  will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.  If
  you plan to use more than one network card under linux, read the
  Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

Ansel Communications EISA 3200 support
CONFIG_AC3200
  If you have a network (ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If you plan to use more than
  one network card under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO,
  available from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

Apricot Xen-II on board ethernet
CONFIG_APRICOT
  If you have a network (ethernet) controller of this type, say Y and
  read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say N here and read
  README.modules. If you plan to use more than one network card under
  linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

DE425, DE434, DE435 support
CONFIG_DE4X5
  If you have a network (ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  More specific information is
  contained in drivers/net/README.de4x5. If you plan to use more than
  one network card under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO,
  available from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

Zenith Z-Note support
CONFIG_ZNET
  The Zenith Z-Note notebook computer has a built-in network
  (ethernet) card, and this is the Linux driver for it. Note that the
  IBM Thinkpad 300 is compatible with the Z-Note and is also supported
  by this driver. Read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.

Pocket and portable adaptors
CONFIG_NET_POCKET
  Cute little network (ethernet) devices which attach to your parallel
  port ("pocket adaptors"). If you have one of those, say Y and read
  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If you plan to use more than
  one network card under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO,
  available from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini. If you
  want to plug a network card into the PCMCIA slot of your laptop
  instead (PCMCIA is the standard for credit card size extension cards
  used by all modern laptops), look in
  cb-iris.stanford.edu:/pub/pcmcia and say N here.  Note that the
  answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N
  will just cause this configure script to skip all the questions
  about this class of network devices.  If you say Y, you will be
  asked for your specific device in the following questions.  If you
  plan to use more than one network card under linux, read the
  Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available via ftp (user anonymous)
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

AT-LAN-TEC/RealTek pocket adaptor support
CONFIG_ATP
  This is a network (ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel
  port. Read drivers/net/atp.c as well as the Ethernet-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO if you want to use this. If
  you plan to use more than one network card under linux, read the
  Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

D-Link DE600 pocket adaptor support
CONFIG_DE600
  This is a network (ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel
  port. Read drivers/net/README.DLINK as well as the Ethernet-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO if you want to use this.  If
  you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say N
  here and read README.modules. If you plan to use more than one
  network card under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO,
  available from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

D-Link DE620 pocket adaptor support
CONFIG_DE620
  This is a network (ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel
  port. Read drivers/net/README.DLINK as well as the Ethernet-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO if you want to use this.  If
  you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say N
  here and read README.modules. If you plan to use more than one
  network card under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO,
  available from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

Sony CDU31A/CDU33A CDROM driver support
CONFIG_CDU31A
  These CDROM drives have a spring-pop-out caddyless drawer, and a
  rectangular green LED centered beneath it. If you have one of these,
  say Y here and also to "ISO9660 cdrom filesystem support"
  below. Read the CDROM-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  NOTE: this CDROM drive
  won't be autodetected by the kernel at boot time; you have to
  provide its specifications as an option to the kernel as described
  in the above README.  See the documentation of your boot loader
  (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel. The lilo
  procedure is also explained in the SCSI-HOWTO.

Mitsumi (not IDE/ATAPI) CDROM driver support
CONFIG_MCD
  This is a very common cd reader. In some models, the whole drive
  chassis slides out for cd insertion.  Later models use a motorized
  tray type mechanism. If you have one of these CDROM drives, say Y
  here and also to "ISO9660 cdrom filesystem support" below. Read the,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) CDROM-HOWTO from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note that this driver does
  not support XA or MultiSession CDs (PhotoCDs). If the driver
  doesn't work out of the box, you might want to have a look at
  linux/include/linux/mcd.h. If your Mitsumi CDROM drive is of type
  IDE/ATAPI, then you have to say N here and should have said Y to
  "Support for IDE/ATAPI CDROMs" above. If unsure, say N now.

Matsushita/Panasonic CDROM driver support
CONFIG_SBPCD
  The Creative Labs Soundblaster CD drives as well as Longshine and
  IBM External ISA also fall under this category. It has a uniquely
  shaped faceplate, with a caddyless motorized drawer which makes it
  recognizable, but has no external brand markings. Some Soundblaster
  drives have a caddy and manual loading/eject, but still no external
  markings. If you have one of these, say Y here and also to "ISO9660
  cdrom filesystem support" below. This driver can support up to four
  CDROM controllers, each of which can support up to four CDROM
  drives; you will be asked how many controllers you have. Read
  drivers/block/README.sbpcd and include/linux/sbpcd.h in the kernel
  source and the CDROM-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If unsure, say N.  If
  you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say N
  here and read README.modules.

Matsushita/Panasonic second CDROM controller support
CONFIG_SBPCD2
  If you have two CDROM drives of this type that you want to use
  simultaneously under Linux, say Y here, otherwise N.

Aztech/Orchid/Okano/Wearnes (non IDE) CDROM support
CONFIG_AZTCD
  If you have a CDA268-01A, ORCHID CD-3110, OKANO/WEARNES CDD110 CDROM
  drive, say Y here and also to "ISO9660 cdrom filesystem support"
  below. This is NOT for CDROM drives with IDE interface, such as
  Aztech CDA269-031SE. (If you have one of those, you should have said
  Y to the new IDE driver above.) You want to read
  drivers/block/README.aztcd and include/linux/aztcd.h in the kernel
  source and the CDROM-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If unsure, say N.  If
  you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say N
  here and read README.modules.

Sony CDU535 CDROM driver support
CONFIG_CDU535
  If you have a CDU-535 or CDU-531 CDROM drive (this is one of the
  older Sony drives with its own interface card), say Y here and also
  to "ISO9660 cdrom filesystem support" below. You want to read
  drivers/block/README.sonycd535 in the kernel source and the
  CDROM-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If unsure, say N.  If you
  want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say N here
  and read README.modules.

Standard (minix) fs support
CONFIG_MINIX_FS
  Minix is a simple operating system used in many classes about
  OS's. The minix filesystem (= method to organize files on a harddisk
  partition or a floppy disk) was the original filesystem for Linux,
  has been superseded by the second extended filesystem ext2fs but is
  still used for root/boot and other floppies or ram disks since it is
  leaner. You don't want to use it on your harddisk because of certain
  built-in restrictions. This option will enlarge your kernel by about
  25 kB. Everyone should say Y so that they are able to read this
  common floppy format.  If you want to compile this as a module
  however ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say N here and read
  README.modules. Note that the filesystem of your root partition
  cannot be compiled as a module.

Extended fs support
CONFIG_EXT_FS
  This is the old Linux filesystem (= method to organize files on a
  harddisk partition or a floppy disk) and not in use anymore. It
  enlarges your kernel by about 25 kB. Let's all kill this beast. Say
  N.

Second extended fs support
CONFIG_EXT2_FS
  This is the de facto standard Linux filesystem (= method to organize
  files on a storage device) for harddisks. You want to say Y, unless
  you intend to use Linux exclusively from inside a DOS partition
  using the umsdos filesystem. The advantage of the latter is that you
  can get away without repartitioning your hard drive (which often
  implies backing everything up and restoring afterwards); the
  disadvantage is that Linux becomes susceptible to DOS viruses and
  that umsdos is somewhat slower than ext2fs. Even if you want to run
  Linux in this fashion, it might be a good idea to have ext2fs
  around: it enables you to read more floppy disks and facilitates the
  transition to a *real* Linux partition later. Another (rare) case
  which doesn't require ext2fs is a diskless Linux box which mounts
  all files over the network using NFS (in this case it's sufficient
  to enable NFS filesystem support below; if you are planning to do
  this, have a look at the package
  /pub/Linux/system/Linux-boot/netboot-nfs.tar.gz, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu, extract with "tar xzvf
  filename"). There is a short ext2fs-FAQ, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/faqs. This
  option will enlarge your kernel by about 41 kB. Default is Y.

xiafs filesystem support
CONFIG_XIA_FS
  This filesystem (= method to organize files on a harddisk partition
  or a floppy disk) is only used rarely these days. This option would
  enlarge your kernel by about 28 kB. Say N.  If you want to compile
  this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from
  the running kernel whenever you want), say N here and read
  README.modules. Note that the filesystem of your root partition
  cannot be compiled as a module.

msdos fs support
CONFIG_MSDOS_FS
  This allows you to mount MSDOS partitions of your harddrive (unless
  they are compressed; the only way to access compressed MSDOS
  partitions under Linux is with the DOS emulator DOSEMU, described in
  the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If you intend to use dosemu
  with a non-compressed MSDOS partition, say Y here) and MSDOS
  floppies. This means that file access becomes transparent, i.e. the
  MSDOS files look and behave just like all other Unix files.  Another
  way to read and write MSDOS floppies from within Linux (but not
  transparently) is with the mtools ("man mtools") program suite,
  which doesn't require the msdos filesystem support.  If you want to
  use umsdos, the Unix-like filesystem on top of DOS, which allows you
  to run Linux from within a DOS partition without repartitioning,
  you'll have to say Y here. This option will enlarge your kernel by
  about 25 kB. If unsure, say Y.  If you want to compile this as a
  module however ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from
  the running kernel whenever you want), say N here and read
  README.modules. Note that the filesystem of your root partition
  cannot be a module.

umsdos: Unix like fs on top of std MSDOS FAT fs
CONFIG_UMSDOS_FS
  Say Y here if you want to run Linux from within an existing DOS
  partition of your harddrive. The advantage of this is that you can
  get away without repartitioning your hard drive (which often implies
  backing everything up and restoring afterwards) and hence you're
  able to quickly try out Linux or show it to your friends; the
  disadvantage is that Linux becomes susceptible to DOS viruses and
  that UMSDOS is somewhat slower than ext2fs.  Another use of umsdos
  is to write files with long unix filenames to MSDOS floppies; it
  also allows unix style softlinks and owner/permissions of files on
  MSDOS floppies. You will need a program called umssync in order to
  make use of umsdos. Read fs/umsdos/README. This option enlarges your
  kernel by about 25 kB. If unsure, say N.
  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say N here and read README.modules. Note that the filesystem of your
  root partition cannot be a module.

/proc filesystem support
CONFIG_PROC_FS
  This is a virtual filesystem providing information about the status
  of the system. "Virtual" means that it doesn't take any space on
  your harddisk: the files are created on the fly when you access
  them. Also, you cannot read the files with less or more: you need to
  use cat. The filesystem is explained in the Kernel Hacker's Guide,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP.  This option will enlarge your
  kernel by about 18 kB. It's totally cool; for example, "cat
  /proc/interrupts" gives information about what the different IRQs
  are used for at the moment (there is a small number of Interrupt
  ReQuest lines in your computer that are used by the periphery to
  gain the CPU's attention - often a source of trouble if two devices
  are mistakenly configured to use the same IRQ). Several programs
  depend on this, so everyone should say Y here.
  
NFS filesystem support
CONFIG_NFS_FS
  If you are connected to a network (using SLIP, PPP or ethernet, not
  term [term is a program which gives you almost full Internet
  connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on some
  Internet connected Unix computer. Read the Term-HOWTO, available via
  ftp (user: anonymous) on sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO] and
  want to mount files residing on another UNIX computer (the NFS
  server) using the NetworkFileSharing protocol, say Y. "Mounting
  files" means that the client can access the files with usual UNIX
  commands as if they were sitting on the client's harddisk. For this
  to work, the server must run the programs nfsd and mountd (but does
  not need to have NFS filesystem support enabled). NFS is explained
  in the Network Administrator's Guide, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP, and in the
  manpage: "man nfs". There is also a NFS-FAQ in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/faqs which presumes that you know
  the basics of NFS already. If you say Y here, you should have said Y
  to TCP/IP networking also. This option would enlarge your kernel by
  about 27 kB. If you don't know what all this is about, say N.

ISO9660 cdrom filesystem support
CONFIG_ISO9660_FS
  This is the standard filesystem used on CDROMs. It was previously
  known as "High Sierra Filesystem" and is called "hsfs" on other Unix
  systems. If you have a CDROM drive and want to do more with it than
  just listen to audio CDs and watch its LEDs, say Y (and read the
  CDROM-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO), thereby enlarging your
  kernel by about 27 kB; otherwise say N.  If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say N here and read
  README.modules.

OS/2 HPFS filesystem support (read only)
CONFIG_HPFS_FS
  OS/2 is IBM's operating system for PC's, the same as Warp, and HPFS
  is the filesystem used for organizing files on OS/2 harddisk
  partitions. Say Y if you want to be able to read files from an OS/2
  HPFS partition of your harddrive. OS/2 floppies however are in
  regular MSDOS format, so you don't need this option in order to be
  able to read them. Read fs/hpfs/README. If unsure, say N.
  
System V and Coherent filesystem support
CONFIG_SYSV_FS
  SCO, Xenix and Coherent are commercial Unix systems for intel
  machines. Enabling this option would allow you to read and write to
  and from their floppies and harddisk partitions. If you have a
  floppy or harddisk partition like that, it is probable that they
  contain binaries from those other Unix systems; in order to run
  these binaries, you will want to install iBCS2 (iBCS2 [Intel Binary
  Compatibility Standard] is a kernel module which lets you run SCO,
  Xenix, Wyse, Unix Ware, Dell Unix and System V programs under Linux
  and is often needed to run commercial software, most prominently
  WordPerfect. It's in tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/BETA). If you only
  intend to mount files from some other Unix over the network using
  NFS, you don't need this (but you need nfs filesystem support
  obviously). Note that this option is generally not needed for
  floppies, since a good portable way to transport files between
  unixes (and even to other operating systems) is given by the tar
  program ("man tar").  Note also that this option has nothing to do
  whatsoever with the option "System V IPC". Read about the System V
  filesystem in fs/sysv/README. This option will enlarge your kernel
  by about 34 kB. If you haven't heard about all of this before, it's
  safe to say N.  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want), say N here and read README.modules.

Cyclades async mux support
CONFIG_CYCLADES
  This is a card which gives you many serial ports. You would need
  something like this to connect more than two modems to your linux
  box, for instance in order to become a BBS. If you haven't heard
  about it, it's safe to say N.

Parallel printer support
CONFIG_PRINTER
  If you intend to attach a printer to one of the parallel ports of
  your Linux box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the
  connector at the printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's
  serial), say Y. Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. To
  compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say N here
  and read README.modules. If you intend to use PLIP (Parallel Line
  Internet Protocol is mainly used to create a mini network by
  connecting the parallel ports of two local machines) in addition to
  a parallel printer, you have the following options: 1) If both PLIP
  and the printer are to use the same parallel port (presumably
  because you have just one), then you should compile both PLIP and
  this printer support as modules, always loading the one you need and
  then removing it again. 2) If PLIP and the printer are to use
  different ports, change the macro LP_NO to 2 or 1 in
  drivers/char/lp.c and say Y to both the parallel printer support and
  PLIP.

Logitech busmouse support
CONFIG_BUSMOUSE
  Logitech mouse connected to a proprietary interface card. It's
  generally a round connector with 9 pins. Note that the newer mice
  made by Logitech don't use the Logitech protocol anymore; for those,
  you don't need this option. You want to read the Busmouse-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If you are unsure, say N and
  read the HOWTO nevertheless: it will tell you what you have. Chances
  are that you have a regular serial MouseSystem or Microsoft mouse
  (made by Logitech) plugging in a COM port (rectangular with 9 or 25
  pins) which is supported automatically.

PS/2 mouse (aka "auxiliary device") support
CONFIG_PSMOUSE
  The PS/2 mouse connects to a special mouse port that looks much like
  the keyboard port (small circular connector with 6 pins). This way,
  the mouse does not use any serial ports. This port can also be used
  for other input devices like light pens, tablets, keypads. Compaq,
  AST and IBM all use this as their mouse port on currently shipping
  machines. The trackballs of some laptops are PS/2 mice
  also. Although this is not a busmouse, it is explained in detail in
  the Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If you are unsure, say N and
  read the HOWTO nevertheless: it will tell you what you have. Chances
  are that you have a regular serial MouseSystem or Microsoft mouse
  plugging in a COM port (9 or 25 pins) which is supported
  automatically.

C&T 82C710 mouse port support (as on TI Travelmate)
CONFIG_82C710_MOUSE
  This is a certain kind of PS/2 mouse used on the TI Travelmate. If
  you are unsure, try first to say N here and come back if the mouse
  doesn't work. Read the Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.

Microsoft busmouse support
CONFIG_MS_BUSMOUSE
  These animals (also called Inport mice) are connected to an
  expansion board using a round connector with 9 pins. If this is what
  you have, say Y and read the Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If
  you are unsure, say N and read the HOWTO nevertheless: it will tell
  you what you have. Chances are that you have a regular serial
  MouseSystem or Microsoft mouse plugging in a COM port which is
  supported automatically.

ATIXL busmouse support
CONFIG_ATIXL_BUSMOUSE
  This is a rare type of busmouse that is connected to the back of an
  ATI video card. Note that most ATI mice are actually Microsoft
  busmice. Read the Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If you are
  unsure, say N and read the HOWTO nevertheless: it will tell you what
  you have. Chances are that you have a regular serial MouseSystem or
  Microsoft mouse plugging in a COM port (9 or 25 pins) which is
  supported automatically.

Selection (cut and paste for virtual consoles)
CONFIG_SELECTION
  This allows you to use your mouse for moving text on a Linux console
  or even between several virtual consoles. Read about it with "man
  selection". You also need it to run gpm ("general purpose mouse")
  which is a superset of selection. This is explained in the
  Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO, although selection works fine
  with serial mice, too. Most people say Y unless they run mainly the
  X Window System, which has its own cut-and-paste mechanism. Enabling
  this option enlarges your kernel by about 1 kB. Newer kernels
  contain this code by default and don't have this config option
  anymore. 

QIC-02 tape support
CONFIG_QIC02_TAPE
  If you have a non-SCSI tape drive like that, say Y.

Do you want runtime configuration for QIC-02
CONFIG_QIC02_DYNCONF
  You can either configure this driver once and for all by editing a
  header file, in which case you should say N, or you can fetch a
  program via anonymous ftp which is able to configure this driver
  during runtime. If you want this, say Y.

QIC-117 tape support
CONFIG_FTAPE
  Most tape drives using the floppy disk controller will need
  this. Colorado Jumbo, Conner Tape-Stor would be two models of this.
  If you have a non-SCSI tape device like that, say Y. QIC-40 users
  say Y too. And everyone read the Ftape-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Tape drives that attach to
  the parallel port, like the Colorado Tracker, are not yet supported
  by Linux.  Note that saying Y here will not insert the code into the
  kernel: instead, a module will be compiled ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). Read README.modules to find out how to use it.

number of ftape buffers
NR_FTAPE_BUFFERS 3
  The kernel driver for the tape drive connected to the floppy disk
  controller needs some memory allocated in the kernel.  If you enter
  n here, then n buffers, each having 32 kB, will be
  allocated. Consequently, the size of the running kernel will
  increase by n*32 kB. You should accept the default unless you know
  what you're doing.

Sound card support
CONFIG_SOUND
  If you have a Sound Card in your Computer, i.e. if it can say more
  than an occasional beep, say Y. Be sure to have all the information
  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it. You
  want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. I'm told that
  even without a sound card, you can make your computer say more than
  an occasional beep, by programming the PC speaker. Kernel patches
  and programs to do that are at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/console/pcsndrv-X.X.tar.gz,
  to be extracted with "tar xzvf filename".

Kernel profiling support
CONFIG_PROFILE
  This is for kernel hackers who want to know how much time the kernel
  spends in the various procedures. The information is stored in
  /proc/profile (enable the /proc filesystem!) and in order to read
  it, you need the readprofile package from sunsite.unc.edu. Its
  manpage gives information regarding the format of profiling data. To
  become a kernel hacker, you can start with the Kernel Hacker's
  Guide, available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP. Mere mortals say N.
 
Profile shift count
CONFIG_PROFILE_SHIFT
  This is used to adjust the granularity with which the addresses of
  executed instructions get recorded in /proc/profile. But since you
  enabled "Kernel profiling support", you must be a kernel hacker and
  hence you know what this is about :-)

Verbose SCSI error reporting (kernel size +=12K)
CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS
  The error messages regarding your SCSI hardware will be easier to
  understand if you enable this; it will enlarge your kernel by about
  12KB. If in doubt, say Y.
