  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5w7VS2sxD0">Where is Mathematics Going?</a>, video of 2025 talk by Kevin Buzzard</li>
    <li><a href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4">The natural number game</a>, a browser based gentle introduction to Lean 4 and the Peano axioms of the natural numbers</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=136e2d8pWlc">Watch someone play the number game</a>; only go here if you get stuck; it's long</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZjAghqKOjI">Continuous functions in Lean 4</a>, video showing how to formalize the epsilon-delta criterion for continuous functions in Lean 4, and how to prove things about it. It is pretty fast paced and you won't understand everything right away.</li>
    <li> You can install Lean 4 on your own machine, along with the free VS Code editor, or you can use Lean online, in your browser:
      <ul><li><a href="https://lean-lang.org/install/">Installing Lean 4 and VS Code on your machine</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://live.lean-lang.org/">Live Lean 4 online</a>, running in the web browser</li>
        </ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/GlimpseOfLean/blob/master/README.md">A Glimpse of Lean</a>, a tutorial that gives a fairly short introduction to the most important aspects of Lean 4. You can follow along either with your own local Lean installation of with Live Lean 4 online</li>
    <li><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/">Mathematics in Lean</a>. This is a book that explains it all slowly and systematically. It's best to use it with a local installation of Lean and VS Code, so that you can play with the examples and do the exercises.</li>
  </ul>
