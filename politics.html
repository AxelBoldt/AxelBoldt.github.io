<H3><A name=ads>Advertising</A></H3>

The idea behind a market economy is that the
best product will eventually win, in a Darwinian manner. However, it does not
work like that in the real world. Usually, the product with the best advertising
campaign wins, which makes it very difficult for small companies to compete,
even if they can offer better quality. It is in the best interest of a healthy
capitalistic system to abolish advertising and replace it by simple
informational messages about available products.

<P>The only purpose of an economy is to satisfy the material needs of the
people. In theory, at least. In practice, businesses spend a major amount of
their time and energy trying to <EM>create</EM> new needs. So consumers work a
lot to earn a lot to buy a lot, stuff they don't really need. And then they die.
It's all a tremendous waste. If consumerism was somehow taken away, many people
would perceive their lives as void, and that is scary.

<P>Every first time smoker will tell you that smoking tastes awful. Nicotine
doesn't even produce a high worth speaking of. Still many people smoke. The only
explanation I have is that smoking is presented as "cool" by the advertising
industry, at least cool enough to try it often enough to become addicted.

<p>Childhood obesity is not related to hours of TV
consumption as was previously thought, <a
href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100209095753.htm">but
to the number of junk food ads viewed</a>. How can these advertisers
live with themselves? The lowest of scum. Ads targeting
children are clearly immoral and should be illegal: children are not
mature enough to see through the lies.

<P>Moreover, advertising is a very conservative, retarding factor in today's
society: If you want to sell a product, you will have to allude to values,
feelings, ideas and images that are well-known and well-liked by the majority,
thereby reinforcing them. New values have an extremely hard time to enter the
mainstream in this climate.
<BR>Example: No one would try to sell a car with a
picture of a fat woman, since, at this point, only a minority of men prefer
these women. Therefore, you see young and slim women everywhere and the beauty
ideal can hardly ever change, if at all.

<P>In Germany, advertising by lawyers and doctors is not allowed. It works
perfectly well; nobody seems to have trouble finding a lawyer or a doctor.

<P>It is a myth that advertising provides us with free TV, radio, and
web sites.  The advertising budgets of major corporations are
enormous, and everyone who wants to compete with them has to spend at
least as much. These costs are of course handed down to us, the
consumers. Advertising raises demand and therefore, by elementary
economics, also raises prices. Not only do they fill our brains with
crap and steal our time, they also make us pay for it.<BR>It thus
makes economic sense to avoid products which are heavily
advertised. Buying such a product implies financing things you don't
want: radio ads, TV commercials, web banners, junk mail and
billboards.<BR>

<P>Advertising is offensive in at least two ways: philosophically and personally. It is philosophically
offensive, because it uses tried
and proven propaganda techniques such as omissions, half-truths, suggestive
associations and appeal to emotions, but rarely any hard verifiable facts.
Its stated objective is to <em>widen</em> the gap between perception
and reality. Every serious thinking and perceiving being should try everything to <EM>reduce</EM> that very gap. 

<P>Advertising is also personally offensive.
Take your average car commercial: a happy family, driving in some
unpolluted landscape without any traffic congestion, everybody is happy, nice
music in the background, and the text "Exercise your liberty. Drive Ford" or
some such nonsensical bullshit. This ad quite openly tells me: "You
are a fucking moron. If you buy a car, you don't care about its price, features, mileage,
theft and accident statistics, insurance rates etc.; you will buy it simply because we played some nice
music while we showed it to you. In addition, you are way too stupid to see
through our little tricks, even though you have probably analyzed many ads like
these in fifth grade. Wow, you are so fucking dumb. Now go ahead and buy the
Ford."

<P>Many broadcasters and magazine publishers today are in the business of
selling attentive audiences to advertisers. This affects the media content
dramatically: advertisers like to pay for consumers who are in a positive,
optimistic, buying mood. Critical thinking, depressing thoughts, deep story
lines: not wanted.

<P>Advertising is an unstable, exploding system: the more advertising there is,
the more it is ignored and the more of it is needed in order to get the message
across. There is no end. All paid for by the consumers.

<P>My main argument, however, is the following: We use up an unbelievable amount
of resources (thereby ruining the environment) without significantly elevating our level of
happiness. I blame the advertising industry for that. The one
message contained in each and every commercial is: <BLINK><STRONG>Buy more stuff
and you'll be happy!</STRONG></BLINK>

<P>A ban on advertising could be enforced very easily: simply allow
businesses to sue competitors over infractions. The "crime" of advertising
cannot be hidden very effectively... Businesses would still be allowed to
publish the specifications of their products and services in widely available
listings, similar to the yellow pages. Magazines would continue to publish reviews.

<P>If you feel like me, please support the following organizations:

</UL>

Whenever you are about to buy a product and find yourself remembering
an advertisement for it, it's a good idea to choose another
product. You don't want to pay for the incredible lengths this
company went to in order to sneak into your brain. This is especially
true for branded products, which should be boycotted. Anything that
weakens the power of brands, like producing, buying and wearing
counterfeit versions, is laudable.<p>

<H3><A name=prostitution>Prostitution</A></H3>

Prostitution should be completely
legalized, regulated, and treated as an ordinary business, subject to taxes,
social security, zoning laws etc.

<P>Laws against prostitution have the sole effect of providing profits for
organized crime and stigmatizing the working men and women and their customers.
The often very bad working conditions of prostitutes are a consequence of
non-existent labor laws and missing collective bargaining rights combined with
the impossibility to get help from the police if abused or cheated on. The
pimping laws have the effect that every man who lives with a prostitute has to
fear overzealous prosecutors.

<P>The effects on public health of legalization accompanied by
regular, mandatory and free health checkups (as in Nevada)
for all prostitutes are also quite clear. For instance, the incidence
of sexually transmitted diseases among Nevada brothel prostitutes is
lower than that in the general population. [Note however that the
situation of prostitutes in Nevada is rather exploitative; an <A
href="http://www.bayswan.org/Laura.html">insider report</A> appeared
recently on the web.]

<p>Even in countries where the legal status of prostitutes is
satisfactory, such as in the Netherlands and Germany, discrimination
and stigmatization continues and accounts for many psychological
problems. Often the women are forced to live a double life and to lie to
their friends and family about their true occupation. This must stop.
Especially the happy customers need to speak up.

<P>In a world where more and more work is being done by machines,
computers and robots, both supply and demand of personal services such
as prostitution are bound to increase.

<P>Married women should recognize prostitutes as their natural
allies. Many women cannot or do not want to satisfy some sexual wishes
of their husbands sufficiently often; many husbands don't even want to voice those wishes. As a
consequence, many marriages are held together because the man has an outlet
in prostitution, and many other marriages break up because the man
does not. It is simply a fact of biology that a well-off
fifty-year-old male is attracted to, and attracts, younger women, and
will often leave his fifty-year-old wife for a girlfriend unless he
can unproblematically buy sexual services from those younger women.

<P>Prostitutes perform an important service in society and should be
treated accordingly. There is nothing morally wrong with prostitution:
society already allows and encourages the buying and selling of food,
shelter, entertainment, compassionate conversations, and medical services. Buying and
selling of sexual services is no different. Providing direct pleasure to
another human being is noble, not immoral. Good prostitutes are able to
fake emotions convincingly, and not even that is immoral:
psychotherapists, actors, singers and undertakers do the same.

<P>Some people believe that something as valuable and central to human
life as sex should always be given away for free out of love. They forget
one thing: food is in fact much more valuable and central to our lives
than sex, but rarely given away for free.

<P><A href="#toc">(Back to

<H3><A name=bullfights>Bullfights, Rodeos etc.</A></H3>

Every city or business
offering the torturing of animals as entertainment should be boycotted.

<P><A href="#toc">(Back to

<H3><A name=drugs>Drugs</A></H3>

Soft drugs like marijuana or hashish should be
legalized and treated like alcohol and nicotine. The current drug laws secure
the profits of organized crime and fill prisons but have no positive effect.

<P>Laws against soft drugs are not justified since these drugs are no more
dangerous than the legal ones. In fact, nicotine is much more addictive than
marijuana, and alcohol is much more toxic. It is true that marijuana smoke is
slightly more carcinogenic than tobacco smoke, but the average consumption per
user is much lower and marijuana can be ingested and is then completely
harmless. 

<P>The argument that marijuana be an entry drug to harder substances is void:
Every junkie will tell you that she started out very early with nicotine and
alcohol, not with marijuana. The only danger with marijuana is that it is
usually bought from a dealer who also sells hard drugs, which makes the
transition easy. That is however not a problem of marijuana itself but one of
its illegal status.

<P>The demonization of a relatively harmless substance has the effect that
people don't believe any drug information anymore. "Maybe it's all a hoax and
heroin isn't that bad after all?"

<P>Specially trained doctors should be allowed to prescribe hard drugs to
persons who are demonstrably addicted to them and who would then have to consume
them in the doctor's presence. This would have the following consequences:

<UL>
  <LI>Dealers are driven out of business since the only customers left are those
  who are not yet addicted and there is no money to be made from those; no more
  fights between rivaling drug gangs.
  <LI>No junkie is forced to become a criminal anymore to sustain their habit.
  Hence a dramatic decrease in crime, prison and law enforcement costs would
  ensue.
  <LI>Fewer junkies die because the substances they take are clean and of
  constant quality; furthermore, drug users stay in constant contact with a
  doctor, who can suggest therapies to them.
  <LI>Aids among injecting drug users vanishes.
</UL>

These proposals will generally be applauded by everyone whose first
concern is the reduction of the number of drug-deaths; some people's
first concern however is the utter demonization of drugs. There's a
simple moral argument against the latter position: the most basic
human right is the right to pursue happiness.<p>

I wrote the above text in the late 1990s. Since then, there have been several very positive developments: 


<p><a href="#toc">(Back to

<h3><a name="abort">Mandatory Education before Abortions</a></h3>
Several 
jurisdictions are now implementing requirements for women to undergo mandatory 
counseling and education before being allowed to have an abortion. These 
programs are usually sold as "providing full information about consequences and 
alternatives, to allow for an informed decision". This is of course bullshit; 
the sole idea behind these requirements is to create psychological pressure and 
make abortions more difficult and inconvenient. Proof: None of these 
"informational" programs inform about the fact that a woman is about 11 times as 
likely to die from giving birth than from having an abortion. (This factor is 
even higher in the developing world.) 

<p><a href="#toc">(Back to

<h3><a name="mcd">McDonalds and Fast Food</a></h3>

It is really amazing how a 
single company can do each and everything wrong: 
<ul>
  <li>Although making good profits, they pay minimum wage and no health care 
  benefits (in the US). 
  <li>They don't allow unions in their company (even in Germany). They only hire 
  on a one-year basis and everyone engaging in union activity won't get a second 
  contract. 
  <li>The restaurants produce huge amounts of garbage. The company doesn't 
  listen to environmental concerns and just refuses to consider reusable plates 
  and silverware. These restaurants also produce quite a bit of air pollution. 
  <li>They litter all sorts of nice old towns (especially in Europe) with their 
  childish looking restaurants. 
  <li>The food is as unhealthy as it comes: low fiber, high fat, high sodium, 
  high sugar, low vitamins; lots of meat and few fruits and vegetables. It would 
  be difficult to design a more harmful diet without using outright poisons. 
  Just like tobacco products, junk food should carry a mandatory warning from 
  health authorities. 
  <li>They use several advertising gimmicks to peddle this disgusting stuff to 
  young children, in order to get them hooked very early on, just like nicotine 
  dealers do. 
  <li>Read about the <a href="http://www.mcspotlight.org/home.html">McLibel 
  case</a> in the UK: McDonalds sued two London Greenpeace activists for 
  distributing <a 
  href="http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/pretrial/factsheet.html">critical 
  leaflets</a>. And they sure regret it by now. 

</ul>
Wait! Not 
<em>everything</em> is bad about them: they provide great places to shit. 

<p><a href="#toc">(Back to

<h3><a name="medical">Medical Research</a></h3>

Medical research is a tremendous 
waste of time and money. Given that on a global scale, people mostly die from 
malnutrition, diarrhea, malaria and tuberculosis, all of which can be easily 
prevented or cured with clean drinking water, food and currently available 
medicines, it does not make sense to produce ever more drugs and treatments. We 
are obviously not willing to employ those we have, so why waste resources 
developing ever more of them? The proper order would be to first spend the money 
to ensure that the currently available drugs get to the places where they are 
needed. 
<p>

People who go into medical research because they want to do some good for 
mankind are lying to themselves, and deep down, they must know it. Five minutes 
of clear thought would reveal that they could save many more lives outside of 
the medical industry. These are unpleasant thoughts however, because intelligent 
people almost always prefer well-defined, "hard" problems ("How does HIV infect 
T-helper cells?", "Is there a violence-gene?") to the more important "soft" 
problems ("How to make sure that people in Ghana have access to and use 
condoms?", "Why are there children whose only successful role models are 
criminals?"). "Soft" problems are of course much harder than "hard" ones, and 
that's why people shy away from them.

<p>The only way to justify the current practices of using the results of 
medical research is to take the morally indefensible position that first world 
lives are worth more than third world lives. 

<p>An immediate, sensible demand is that poor countries be allowed to 
manufacture patented drugs royalty free for domestic use. Drug companies 
wouldn't lose any money since nobody in these countries is able to pay regular 
prices anyway. 

<p><a href="#toc">(Back to

<H3><A name=incest>Incest</A></H3>

Sex between consenting adult relatives should be legal, obviously. The
fact that many people find the idea repulsive is no reason for a
general prohibition; I find fundamentalist Christian TV preachers
revolting, for example.<p>

Sex among relatives results in a slightly higher probability of
producing disabled children. For good reason, we don't outlaw sex
among people carrying genetic defects, even if it might result in a
disabled child; outlawing incest is
wrong for the same reason.

<P><A href="#toc">(Back to

<H3><A name=recycling>Recycling</A></H3>

is a misnomer, and current propaganda
about it is misleading all the way.

<P>It is a misnomer, because there is no such thing as "recycling". It
is all downcycling. If you start with a piece of paper, you "recycle"
it, you'll end up with paper of lower quality. You "recycle" again,
you'll have still lower quality. And after that, you can't "recycle"
any more at all. It's the same with all other materials. Furthermore,
this downcycling process eats up tremendous amounts of energy.

<P>Downcycling is not only an insufficient means of preserving
resources, but given the way it is advertised, it is detrimental in
allowing people to have a good conscience when they put their
newspaper in the recycling bin instead of throwing it away. In truth,
they should still have a bad conscience. Consumption is the problem
and it has to be attacked. We have to learn to live with less
stuff. Downcycling is no solution, it only puts sand in our eyes. The
major message should be "Use less stuff" and not "Always put your
stuff in the downcycling bin".

<P><A href="#toc">(Back to

<H3><A name=global>Climate Change</A></H3>
Almost all climatologists agree that the earth is currently
undergoing climate change, and that that change is due to
greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity. Except
for a handful of contrarians, the only experts disputing this consensus 
are on the payroll of industries with a vested interest.<p>

Climate is an unstable system, and nobody can predict the precise
extent and consequences of the change. Since gambling with planetary systems
is a bad idea, prudence requires that we drastically cut down our
greenhouse gas emissions.<p>

All this has been known for at least 25 years, a couple of treaties
have been signed, but basically nothing has been done. Global
greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. It
seems certain that we won't stop burning fossil fuels until all of
them have been burned. Apparently, neither nations nor individuals will 
take concrete actions just to avoid some nebulous future risk.<p>

Many countries will be harmed by the effects of global warming while a few
others will benefit. We need a global treaty ensuring that the
harmed countries are properly compensated. Every couple of years, a
commission would determine every country's cost or benefits resulting
from climate change, as well as the degree to which the country has
contributed to the problem (taking into account the country's total
emissions over time, not just the most recent emissions). These numbers
would form the basis for international compensation payments. Such a scheme
would create true incentives for the countries to reduce their emissions.

<H3><A name=rape>Rapists and Child Molesters</A></H3>

I believe that it is almost impossible to cure repeat rapists and
child molesters. For these people, sexuality is simply miswired and
connected to stimuli that society disapproves of. <p>

While it is easy to say "these people are bad and immoral and if they don't stop their behavior, they deserve to be punished", one should first imagine how difficult it would be for
oneself to completely give up one's sexually arousing stimuli. For
obvious biological reasons, sexuality is the strongest motivating
force in the mind. So I don't see these offenders as very culpable in a moral sense, since they did not initiate the wiring
of their sexuality. <p>

How then to deal with rapists and child molesters? Obviously society needs to be protected from
them. I can imagine technical devices to do so, maybe a tiny camera affixed
to their head to allow remote supervision,
along with a device that lets the remote supervisor
apply electric shocks. One person can easily monitor a dozen
offenders, with the price being a fraction of normal prison/therapy costs.

<H3><A name=drunk>Blood Alcohol Level and Driving</A></H3>

Currently, virtually all countries outlaw driving
with a certain amount of alcohol in the blood. This is
inappropriate, for the following reasons:
<ul>
  <li>people do not usually know their blood alcohol level
  <li>while some people with a high blood alcohol level are still able
  to drive, others are already unfit to drive with a low blood alcohol level
  <li>the criterion completely disregards the many other ways to be
  impaired
</ul>

Whether a person is fit to drive should instead be determined with a
fitness test that involves reaction time, visual acuity and risk
estimation abilities. A driving-simulation video game seems to be
appropriate. <p>

It would even be possible to build such a video game into every car,
so that the car won't start unless you pass the game. Of course, the
simulated situations should keep changing for this to work. The games
could be regularly updated via radio.

<P><A href="#toc">(Back to

<H3><A name=smoke>Anti-Smoking Campaign</A></H3>

Teenagers have only one purpose in life: they want to be cool; they
want to be accepted by their peers. Cigarette commercials play exactly
on that need: they portray smoking as the ultimate cool thing, the
activity of the in-crowd. They succeed admirably well.<p>

There is nothing more uncool than doing what you're told to do. That's
why prohibiting smoking and health warnings on packages are all
completely useless.
An effective anti-smoking campaign simply needs to tell teenagers that

Smoking should be forbidden wherever people work. It's a simple matter
of worker protection: workplaces have to be free from carcinogens. I'm
sure a chemical factory would be closed immediately if the air

<H3><A name=peer>Peer Review and Scientific Publishing</A></H3>

The peer review process used for scientific publishing is
broken. Reviewers are anonymous and unpaid and have next to no
incentive to hand in decent work in a timely manner; reviews are secret.<p>

The process should be opened up in a radical manner; referees
would have to publish their signed reports and recommendations. In this
way they could receive academic credit for reviewing
work, they would have an incentive to file solid reviews, and others could
check the reasons for why an article was rejected.<p>

The scientific publishing system, still largely based on paper
journals, is broken. The real work is done by authors, editors and
referees, all of whom are unpaid. The publisher sells the end result
for large amounts of money. The work is then hidden away in libraries
and is not made freely available to the public who funded the research
in the first place. The internet is largely bypassed. Researchers in
poor countries are cut out of the loop entirely.<p>

Both problems can be fixed with one stroke:

<ul>
<li>reviews can be attached to preprints,

<H3><A name=edu>Funding Higher Education</A></H3>

In Germany, public higher education is largely free and financed by tax money
(except for low tuition started recently in several states). This
appears unjust as even people who never enjoyed a higher education
have to contribute taxes. In the U.S., students have to pay for higher
education, which appears unjust as the poor are locked out or are
burdened with high debt afterwards. <p>

The correct way to finance higher education is the one invented and used by the
German private university Witten-Herdecke: students don't pay anything
until they are finished with their studies and have acquired a well-paying job,
at which point they are required to pay 10% of their disposable income to the
university for a period of 10 years. In this way the poor and rich are
treated alike, those who profit most
from the education also pay the most, and the university has a natural
incentive to produce graduate well versed for the job market.

Most countries specify a certain age after which a person is allowed to retire and draw social security benefits. I don't see the necessity for this at all. The system could be designed much more flexibly: you may retire at any age, and your monthly social security allowance until death will be calculate based on the number of years you have worked and on your age at retirement. Any actuary will easily be able to figure out the correct formula insuring that the retirement system never loses any money, no matter when you decide to retire. People retiring early means fewer jobless young people; people retiring late means fewer years of benefits: it's all good.

<H3><A name=corr>Corruption</A></H3>

In most poor countries, corruption is endemic. Understandably, people
who manage to land a government job (and usually have paid for that job)
will attempt to get as much money out of their position as possible.<p>

Here's my proposal about fighting corruption: make the
<em>offering</em> of bribes legal. <em>Accepting</em> a bribe carries
a hefty fine. Anyone who brings evidence of an accepted bribe (say
hidden video footage) receives the fine that the corrupt person has to pay.
<p>

Many people will want to trap authorities and offer fake bribes;
accepting a bribe all of a sudden becomes quite dangerous.<p>

Of course, one somehow has to come up with non-corrupt officials
who administer this mechanism...<p>

The reason that corruption is comparably rare in rich countries is this: government employees make good salaries, have secure jobs, and can look forward to generous pensions. All of this they would risk by accepting a bribe, and the average bribe is normally too small compared to the risk. And there is a positive feedback loop: in a society where bribery is relatively rare, an official caught accepting a bribe has little hope of evading punishment by offering a bribe. All of these effects are reversed in poor countries, so widespread corruption is to be expected.

<H3><A name=salary>Salaries, Taxes, and Individual
Justice</A></H3>

Most people see their jobs as a burden. Only a small minority can
fully identify with and enjoy their occupation, for instance some
scientists, athletes, politicians, or physicians. This group of people
is, in addition, paid much more than average. I believe this is
unjust. Having an interesting, respected, important profession should
be reason enough to become a physician say; those who choose these
jobs because of the money are the wrong people anyway and we would be
better off without them.

<P>Since it is almost a general rule that better paid jobs are also
more pleasant, (only exception I can think of: prostitution, see <A
href="#prostitution">above</A>) and since government dictated salaries
don't work, the logical conclusion is to have a much more progressive
income tax system.

<P>The current income tax system in virtually all countries is based on
fixed tax brackets. But the income distribution changes over time, because
of inflation and other factors, and the brackets have to be constantly 
adjusted. A more rational system, with the very desirable tendency of 
leading to a more equitable income distribution, is the following: an 
individual's tax rate is determined based on the difference between
the individual's income and the average income of the lower 50% of
the population. The larger this difference, the higher the rate, according
to some specified formula. With this scheme, rich people, who are typically
politically influential, have a direct personal interest in improving the 
financial lot of the lower half of society. (Note that using "average income" 
or "median income" in place of "average income of lower 50%" is not as good: 
the former because extremely high salary outliers disproportionally affect the 
average, and the latter because the median is not affected by improving the 
lot of the worst off people.)

<H3><A name=socialism>The Inevitability of a Huge Welfare State</A></H3>

What is the point
of technological progress? Why do we keep building faster computers, better
robots, more efficient factories? There is only one point to all of this:
reducing the workload that has to be done by humans.

<P>There is no question that these projects will become more and more
successful: they have already largely succeeded in agriculture, they are currently about to succeed in manufacture, using robots, and before long they will succeed in the service sector as well, using artificial intelligence. Eventually, most people will be dispensible and their work won't be
needed anymore. Once this development has become obvious to economists and then to journalists, populist politicians will offer the simple solution: tax all automated labor and distribute the revenue to the jobless masses as permanent welfare payments. Obviously these politicians will be elected. The only other solution would be the socialist one: the means of production are declared property of society at large, and profits are distributed to the new owners, i.e. to the jobless masses. In both scenarios you end up with a huge welfare state. 

<P>What will people do if their work is not needed anymore, and their material needs are taken care of? Presumably they will cultivate skills that tend to make them interesting to potential life partners and friends. Study philosophy to be able to engage in intruiging conversations, learn how to cook well, perfect your gardening skills, write engaging stories or video games, discover some interesting new fact in science, learn some foreign languages, etc. Anything that might attract some admirers. Large parts of society will presumably just lazily enjoy life, and there is nothing wrong with that. After all, that was the whole point of technological progress.

<H3><A name=tax>Taxes and the Common Goods</A></H3>

In a <a href="#salary">previous section</a>, when focusing on
individual justice, I came to the conclusion that income taxes should
be more progressive. When I focus on the Common Good, the results are
quite different.

<P>Taxes are used in every society for two reasons: financing of
common tasks such as infrastructure, education, judicial system,
administration, defense and social services on the one hand, and
behavior modification (cigarette taxes, booze taxes, fuel taxes) on
the other. It is important to separate the two.  

<P>The revenue from behavior modification taxes should never be used to finance common
tasks, because otherwise the state gets into a conflict: on the one
hand it wants to eliminate the offensive behavior, but on the other
hand it wants to maximize the tax inflow. Both goals will
suffer. Therefore, money from behavior modification taxes should
always be reserved for projects that serve the same purpose as the
tax, e.g. anti-smoking campaigns in the case of cigarette taxes and
improvements of public transport in the case of fuel taxes.

<P>The taxes that are intended to finance common tasks shouldn't be
"punitive" at all; a behavior that is desirable from the perspective
of the common good should not be taxed. Obviously, this cannot be
achieved completely, but I believe we could do a much better job than
we do now. Currently, we mainly tax salaries of employees and profits
of businesses. It is however not a good idea to discourage people from working
and making money.

<P>Here's my proposal: we remove all income taxes and instead increase
the gift and inheritance taxes to 100% each. While you live, you are
perfectly free to make as much money as you can and enjoy it fully; once 
you're dead, your wealth will be confiscated and used for the common
good. This way, you can't complain that someone took something away
from you, since dead people don't complain (and don't have property
rights). There's another positive effect of this scheme: the children
of rich people will have less of an advantage in life than they enjoy
now; fewer people will be able to live off their inheritance and more
will have to actually work for their living. The playing field will be
a little more level.

<H3><A name=asylum>Asylum Law</A></H3>

In 1993, the German parties SPD, FDP and CDU/CSU agreed to give in to
right wing terroristic violence and abolished the most noble part of
the German constitution, the article which granted every political
refugee in the world an unconditional and directly enforceable right
to asylum in Germany.

<P>This article was clearly a consequence of horrible experiences in
Nazi Germany, when many Jews couldn't get out simply because no one
was willing to let them in.

<P>The perverse provision adopted now, which let the German
authorities immediately send back any refugee entering Germany from a
"safe" country (all countries surrounding Germany have been declared
"safe", of course), would have as consequence, if adopted by every
nation, that only the immediate neighbors of crises would let refugees
in. This is unjust for two reasons: firstly, those countries are
typically extremely poor while Germany is extremely rich, and
secondly, they are certainly no more responsible for the crisis at
hand than other countries are, so they should not have to bear all the
burden.

<H3><A name=dp>Death Penalty</A></H3>

Most advocates of capital punishment concede after some discussion
that in the final analysis, the motive for the death penalty is sheer
revenge. They hate the killer and therefore she must die.  Her dying
makes them feel better: a purely egotistical motive to kill. Revenge
however has no place in a civilized society and belongs rather in the
behavior repertoire of kindergardeners. One of the principal reasons
for creating a system of justice is the elimination of acts of
revenge. To kill a killer is the ultimate philosophical capitulation
of society in face of violence.

<P>The fact that death rows are closely guarded in order to prevent
suicides shows clearly that vengeance combined with sadism, and not
protecting society, is the underlying motive of capital
punishment. Not only do we want her dead, but we want to enjoy
ourselves in the process, and <EM>we</EM> want to determine time,
place and manner of the show. However, once we have decided to act like
barbarians and let all our darkest instincts surface, why not go all
the way? Why stop at psychological torture? Why grant her a nice
painless death by lethal injection?  I propose that, in order to fully
accommodate our desire for revenge, to maximize the deterring effect
and to place the highest possible value on innocent life, murderers
should be dragged naked through the streets and then slowly tortured
to death in public.

<P>Some argue that killing a killer is cheaper than housing her for
the rest of her life; others argue the opposite. The question is
completely irrelevant: the very discussion shows that society has already
acquired the mindset of a killer, namely to think that it can be
worthwhile to kill a human being for financial reasons. That is
precisely what murderers do, and we have no moral right to punish them
if we consider doing the same.

<P>On the side: the US has signed and ratified an international treaty (the <A
href="http://www.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b3ccpr.htm">International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</A>) which explicitly bans,
among other things, the imposition of the death penalty for crimes
committed by minors. Nevertheless, the US continued to sentence minors
to death and executed them, claiming that this be the democratically
expressed will of the American people. This from a nation that demands human rights all over the world. The practice was finally stopped by the Supreme Court in 2005. Mentally retarded people were
also routinely executed, which annually got the US into the <A

nations violating human rights. The Supreme Court stopped this
practice in 2002.

In many states in the USA there are currently legislative initiatives

life in prison. The provisions vary as to whether only violent crimes
count, whether crimes committed as a minor count and whether the
sentence allows for parole or not.

<P>These laws are just about the worst that could happen to the
US. Most criminals are active when young and settle down later. With
this law, they will settle down in prison, for some thirty years on
average. Prisons will turn into nursing homes, thereby wasting
tremendous amounts of money, money which is desperately needed for
work on the socio-economic root causes of crime in America.

<P>Not to mention the obscenity of putting a sixteen-year-old
three-times burglar away for life without parole. This clearly
violates the US constitution which prohibits excessive punishment as

<P>"Campaign Finance Reform" is a very popular goal, but it is unclear
how to structure it, since the Supreme Court ruled that any cap on

<P>Here is my proposal: any candidate for a public office is given a
choice: they can either accept public funds but then cannot use any
other money, or they can forfeit all public funds and are then allowed
to spend as much as they want.  In the second case, they have to file
precise statements about the dollar amount spent on their
campaign. All competitors in the election will then receive that exact
same sum from the government. That way, rich or well connected
candidates don't have any advantage any more; choosing the second
option is not in their best interest, in fact, it will make them

<H3><A name=iraq>Iraq War</A></H3>

The second war against Iraq was not about weapons of mass
destructions: the UN had done an excellent job of destroying those in
the years prior to the war, and the US had spies on the UN weapons
teams and knew the situation. The war also wasn't about fighting
terrorism: Hussein was religiously moderate and did not support
fundamentalist terrorists; by contrast, today, with Hussein gone, Iraq
is clearly the world's center of terrorism training. The war wasn't
about "liberating" the Iraqi people: many other comparable dictators
around the world are being left alone, or have even been supported
(just like Hussein was being supported during the Iran-Iraq war).<p>

So what was the war about? Pure global strategy: the US wanted a
foothold in a strategically important region (important because of the
oil reserves and the closeness to Israel); they did not
want to tolerate a defiant dictator in that region. It was a war of
aggression with the aim of regime change. Therefore it was clearly
illegal, a violation of <a
href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/chapter1.htm">Article 2.4 of
the Charter of the United Nations</a>, as was pointed out by
Secretary General Kofi Annan among others. (The UN Charter was
basically authored by the US after World War II.)<p>

I am not surprised that the Bush administration would engage in an
illegal war of aggression; they do not consider international law
binding, as has been shown subsequently by their brushing aside the
Geneva Conventions when dealing with war prisoners. I am however very
surprised at the stupidity of it all: apparently nobody anticipated
that the Shias, after decades of suppression by the minority Sunnis
and supported by Iran, would demand power, and that the Sunnis, with
all the infrastructure of the old Baathists, would not yield
quietly. You take away Hussein and you get civil war: that much should
have been obvious to the strategists.

<p>
I believe there is also another, more sinister motivation for the
war. Bush wants to divert money from social programs towards his
supporters, large contractors and the defense industry. After he
pushed through immense tax cuts, the war costs nicely drove up the
budget deficit and the public debt. Every billion spent on the war
cannot be spend on Medicare. Every helicopter shot down is money in
the bank of Lockheed Martin. Bush knows that eventually the budget
will have to be balanced, and with the now almost complete taboo on
increasing taxes and cutting defense spending, this balancing can only
be accomplished by cutting government services. The war is thus an
integral part of his long-term strategy of reducing the size of
government entitlement programs. He followed a similar strategy as
governor of Texas: cut taxes, increase spending on pet projects, and
wait for the inevitable cutting of social programs by the legislature.

<p>It is clear that the war cannot be won. The Soviet Union lost in
Afghanistan and the United States lost in Vietnam
and in Somalia and will lose in Iraq. If people are so determined
that they will happily die for their cause, and mothers will happily
send their sons to die, then your laser-guided cruise missiles are
nothing but pointless
expensive toys.

<H3><A name=tariffs>International Tariffs</A></H3>

Free trade between the
nations, unhampered by tariffs, is desirable because it leads to the most
efficient production of goods. "Efficient" here means "using few natural
resources and little labor".

<P>Simply removing all tariffs does not necessarily yield efficient
production: it rewards nations that impose few social and
environmental costs on businesses, which has nothing to do with
efficiency as defined above. A downward spiral towards lower and lower
social and environmental standards is clearly undesirable for everyone
but the capitalist.

<P>A system of international tariffs which rewards efficiency and does
not punish high social and environmental standards is needed. It could
be installed by bilateral or multilateral agreements. The key is that a
nation is only allowed to levy a tariff against another country's good
if the industry in the producing country has a lesser burden of social
and environmental costs than the importing country; in this case, only
the difference in those costs between the two nations may be levied as
a tariff.

<P>Tariffs are never negative, which implies that an industry from a
(rich) country with higher "burdens" has a slight disadvantage
compared to the native industry when it tries to export into a poorer
country. In this way, the internal markets of poorer countries are
somewhat protected against industries from richer countries which have
access to technology not available locally.

<P>The question remains whether salaries should be treated as "social
burdens" in the this scheme. They should: lower salaries do not mean
higher efficiency in the above sense and are therefore not desirable.

<P>All comparisons of the various "burdens" should be carried out
taking into account the purchasing power of the respective
currencies. The daily currency exchange rate is too arbitrary and does
not convey the relevant information for our purposes. When using this
scheme, it would be best to levy the tariffs in the producing
country's currency so that the tariffs would not have to be adjusted
whenever the conversion rate changes.  <P>Some international
arbitrating agency would be needed to resolve disputes arising from
this scheme of tariffs. Once some countries create this agency and
sign according tariff agreements, there is a clear incentive for other
countries to join: they would then be able to improve their social and
environmental standards without jeopardizing their position on the
world market.

<H3><A name=global>Globalization</A></H3>

Globalization in the economical sense typically means that local
markets should be opened to foreign competition and that foreigners
should be allowed to invest in local industries. This is considered to
be a good thing since it improves global market efficiency. Strangely enough,
this definition covers only one half of globalization: the free
movement of capital. Why is the free movement of labor not considered?
The same argument applies: if labor can move to where the demand is
highest, market efficiency increases.

<P>As a first tiny step towards
labor market efficiency, it should be possible for two persons from
different countries to exchange their nationalities if they so choose. In the spirit of
capitalism, this exchange could be linked to a payment from one party
to the other. Everybody wins. See <a
href="citizenship_exchange.html">Citizenship exchange</a> for more
details on and arguments for this proposal.

<p>Rich countries dictate that poorer countries are to enter the world
market and concentrate on
the export of resources and agricultural goods. It is extremely
immoral that those same rich countries ignore the rules of
capitalism when convenient. The European Union pays high
subsidies to its farmers, resulting in large over-production. To keep
the internal prices in the union high, they then pay export subsidies
to get rid of the over-production. This drowns the world market in twice-subsidized
agricultural goods that poor countries cannot possibly compete with. 

<p>The solution is obvious: stop all subsidies and mandate ecological agriculture which uses
little chemicals and no gene-modification. Agricultural yields will
fall, keeping prices high and eliminating over-production. The playing
field on the world market will be level again.

The UN were established in the aftermath of the second world war to
ensure lasting peace among the nations. The most effective way to do
that is to directly attack the logic of army warfare by rewarding
deserters.

<P>In every war, deserters are the most moral actors: they follow the
more basic and important ethical rule of never killing other human
beings and reject the more artificial rule of always obeying
orders.

<P>The UN should actively encourage desertion in every war; deserters
should get a UN medal of honor and some money and an internationally
recognized hero's passport so that
they can resettle wherever they choose.

<H3><A name=gov>World Government</A></H3>

Most people agree that democracy is the best form of
government. However, on a global scale, we have a dictatorship of the
rich and military mighty countries, both in the UN Security Council and,
much more importantly, in the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund (this in addition to the places where the <EM>real</EM> power is
located, i.e. in the multinational corporations). It is all the more
astounding that virtually no one seriously promotes a democratically
elected world government.

<P>Such an institution, elected by the one-person-one-vote rule and
provided with the monopoly on legal military force, is the only hope
for a peaceful community of nations. If you hit me, I won't hit you
back but will turn to the police and the courts instead. We need to
achieve this level of civility in the international arena too.

<P>A world government could also mediate between the rich and poor
countries of the world. Obviously, the poor countries would have the
majority in this government, and that is just, because they have more
people. This is how democracy works.

<H3><A name=justice>Justice</A></H3>

One crucial distinction between leftists and rightists is that the
former acknowledge that a situation in itself can be unjust, while the
latter reserve the label "just/unjust" only for actions.

<P>The fact that a full-time worker in a poor country can barely feed
his family while one in the first world who puts in the same amount of
effort lives in incredible luxury would not be considered unjust by
conservative economists.  They would look at the situation locally,
asking questions like "Is the poor worker forced to work at that
factory?" or "Does the poor worker get the agreed-upon salary?" or
"Has the rich worker gotten his advantage by cheating?"  and so on,
and if they can't find any wrong actions, they will be satisfied and
won't detect any injustice. Leftists however see a structural
injustice in this situation. The problem with this injustice is that
no one in particular can be held responsible, since no single action
can be blamed. Moreover, in many situations, the only way to remedy
unjust situations is to take unjust actions.  Conservatives take the
easy way out of this dilemma by altogether refusing to acknowledge
that a situation in itself can be unjust.

A common claim is that capitalism and democracy go hand in hand; you
cannot have one without the other.  Economical freedom and political
freedom are somehow construed to be two sides of the same
coin. Instead of giving the obvious counterexamples to these claims,
let's look a little bit closer at the structure of capitalistic
institutions themselves: businesses and corporations. Strictly
hierarchically organized, orders going only top-down in one direction,
compliance resulting from fear, completely centralized planning. Does
this sound like democracy or fascism to you?

If you own stocks or mutual fund shares, you partly own some
corporations and you are therefore partly responsible for those
corporation's actions. You cannot get away with "the CEO made that
sleazy decision", because that CEO made that sleazy decision precisely
because he wanted to secure high profits for you. In his mind, he was
doing exactly what you wanted him to do: fire disposable workers,
screw competitors, find loopholes in environmental laws, lie to
consumers in advertisings etc. It's all done in order to maximize
profits and hence to please the owners of the corporation, i.e.,
you. You cannot evade this moral responsibility; whatever your
corporation does is done on your behalf. Just because there are
usually many owners does not mean that responsibility somehow
miraculously evaporates.

to be the current nation of the winner does not contain any relevant

The medal count at the end of the Olympics has got to be the most
idiotic thing ever devised. So China has a quarter of the world's
people. Obviously it will get about a quarter of the medals. So what? Who

I propose instead a division of people along
objective and unchangeable lines: blood type. Each of the four blood
types gets its own anthem and flag, and those shall be used at the

<H3><A name=marriage>Marriage</A></H3>

<center><em>Bigamy is having one spouse too many -- monogamy
is the same.</em> Oscar Wilde</center>

<P>Marriage is an obsolete institution. At a
time where divorces were impossible and women could not earn a living, marriages
were needed to ensure that all women were financially supported. This is no
longer the case; there is no need anymore for a government issued license that
sanctions only one of the multitude of possible living arrangements.

<P>The reason most people marry today is not financial but emotional:
one tries to bind a loved one as tightly as possible. The whole
concept of modern marriage is designed to make separation difficult,
embarrassing and expensive. Divorce is synonymous with failure. Many
people are invited to the wedding ceremony in order to create
psychological pressure: "Before so many friends and family, you
promised to stay with me -- and now?" In addition, divorce is costly
and complicated. The underlying assumption however, that making a
breakup difficult will increase the likelihood of a long and stable
relationship, is clearly wrong. If the relationship doesn't work out,
then it will break, sooner or later. If you're married, it will be
later. And more painful. But it will happen.

<p>However, I may be wrong here. Recent psychological research shows
that people are happier if they have few options and if there is little
possibility of a change. For instance, people sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of
parole adjust better to prison life than those who retain the
possibility of parole; the more options a retirement fund offers, the
fewer people will contribute, etc. While we all prefer situations with options
and hope, these are actually not conducive to our happiness. In this sense
then, a truly unbreakable marriage may be a smart move. Today's
marriages however are easily disolved. How to get around this? I propose
that a couple write a prenuptial contract stating that if the
marriage ends for any reason, both partners must burn all their money
(or donate it to the Republicans or some other distasteful cause) and
must give up all their children for adoption. That way, the couple
will have taken the divorce option completely off the table and should
live a happier life afterwards.

<P>Personally I find a relationship much more exciting and
also more romantic if it can do without any outside pressure
whatsoever. Both partners should be completely free to leave every
day. They stay together simply because they prefer the presence of the
other over absence. And this has to be won every day anew, over and
over again. It's great if it works, and if it has worked for a while
and doesn't anymore, then it is no catastrophe. All security in
matters of the heart is illusory.

<P>At a wedding ceremony, one typically promises to love the partner
forever. Such a promise is clearly immoral, since one has no control
over one's future feelings. It is as if I promise you that it won't
rain tomorrow.

<P>For these reasons, I have a problem with gays who fight for the right to
marry their partners. The goal should not be to get even more people into
government-approved relationships, but to do away with these approvals
altogether. Gays should exploit their peculiar situation and mock the
institution much more than they do now. I propose that a group of gay men pair
off with a group of lesbians and then stage a huge mass wedding party, complete
with official marriage licenses and all, simply to make fun of the whole thing
and to collect the tax breaks. Or will the government only issue its license if
you promise to have sex regularly? How often? What position? Would Ronald Reagan
have been stripped of his marriage license? Questions everywhere.

<P>I recognize however that everyone living in a rich country has an
obvious moral duty to marry someone from a poor country to circumvent
immigration laws and provide the unjustly disadvantaged with an
opportunity to improve their lives and financially support their
families. This duty is even more pronounced in the case of older
persons whose retirement benefits will be inherited by a spouse:
clearly these persons have an obligation to marry a young person from
a poor country. (See also <a href="#thirdworld">Duties Towards People
in Poor Countries</a>.)

<H3><A name=breeding>Thanks for not Breeding</A></H3>

There are way too many people around already. In terms of excessive
consumption, the real overpopulation is located in the first world,
and not in the third. People in the developed countries waste the
world's resources and contribute to the world's environmental problems
as if there were no tomorrow. You have 5% of the world's
population using up 70% of the world's resources, and it's clearly
impossible to bring the other 95% up to the same consumption
level. The lifestyle in the first world is not generalizable and
therefore wrong, according to Kant's Categorical Imperative.

<P>It could and should be called arrogant to believe that one's own
genetic material is so perfect that it should be transported into the
next generation.

<P>Your three year old child prefers books lying on the floor. You
prefer the books organized on shelves. There is no rational reason to
choose one scheme over the other, yet you use your power to enforce
your preference. You clearly have no moral right to do so. "Might is
right."

<P>Do prospective parents never fear that one morning they'll
wake up and realize that they do not particularly like their child? Or
that their child wakes up and realizes that it does not particularly
like them? You can't divorce your children. Some shared genes and a
vast power difference does not always make a good basis for love.

<P>Suppose doctors tell you that your child is going to have trisomy
21 (mongolianism, Down's syndrome), a very common genetic
defect. Trisomy 21 people are among the happiest humans, but severely
handicapped, and yet you will have to care for the child all your life,
then put it in an institution when you get too old. Do you abort the
child?

<P>Do you know how your personality will develop
over the next 15 years? Do you know how your partner's personality
will develop over the next 15 years? Can you guarantee that your
changed self will still love your changed partner in 15 years? If not,
what are you going to do: stay together so that your child has a fake
family experience, or break up so that your child has a true
non-family experience?

<P>Planned Parenthood offers cheap vasectomies and sterilizations.

<P>If you feel the need to care for a child, you should look into
adoption, especially adoption of sick children and children from poor
countries. That way you're doing real good and reduce suffering in the
world, without contributing to the problem. The problem, the central
problem of our time, is overpopulation.

<H3><A name=abortion>Abortion</A></H3>

The main argument of abortion opponents is short, elegant and logical:
"human life begins with conception, killing a human life is murder, so
abortion is murder and therefore forbidden." By comparison, the typical babbling of
abortion proponents is utterly incoherent: "if you don't like
abortions, don't have one; it should be a woman's choice; it's her
body; don't force
your morals on others etc." They completely avoid the central
question: is abortion murder, yes or no? If not, why not?<p>

The debate, therefore, is clearly won by the abortion opponents, but
only because the abortion proponents refuse to argue properly, on
ethical terms. Here are my arguments in favor of abortion:
<ul>
<li>Human life does not begin with conception, simply because it's
possible to create human life without conception. Take an egg out of a
woman's ovary, take one of her skin cells, throw away the egg's
nucleus and replace it with the skin cell's nucleus, and soon a clone of the woman will grow. No sperm ever met
any egg, no conception ever took place, yet a perfectly good human being
will arise. In the future it will probably be possible to grow a
complete human out of a single skin cell alone, not even needing an
egg. So the concept of human life with a binary off/on switch is untenable. Human life begins gradually, as a developing organism
slowly acquires characteristics of a human: to feel pain and hunger, to notice
and interact with the environment, to think. 
<li>If my parents had decided to use a condom that night, I would
never have existed. I would never have thought anything, I would never
have felt anything, I would never have interacted with the
environment. I also certainly wouldn't have a reason to complain,
just like all the other humans who were never born because my parents
chose to watch TV don't have a reason to complain. Now consider the following scenario instead: my
parents did not use a condom, but decided to abort me three months later. From
my perspective, the situation is completely identical. I would never
have thought anything, done anything, felt anything. I also wouldn't
have a reason to complain. The two scenarios, using a condom or not
using a condom and then aborting, are completely equivalent from my
perspective. I am the only morally relevant party in this matter, and the
two scenarios are therefore morally equivalent.

Most of my friends are male; with a couple of notable exceptions, most
females seem to find my thinking foreign. I often wanted to be gay,
but unfortunately I found myself to be wired normally. Everything about gays
seemed cool: their elitism, the avantgarde rejection of traditional modes of
living, their smartness, their richness, their being hated by
religious morons.<p>

Some of this admiration has since evaporated. I am appalled by the vigor
with which gays demand government approval for their relationships in
the form  of marriage licenses: the avantgarde joining the boring
mainstream. Instead of getting straights out of the military, they
fight to get gays into the military! When a Republican hammers
homosexuals in public, gays whine "Discrimination!" -- why not simply
hammer back on the idiot and his infantile religious beliefs?
Many gays also show a fixation on
externalities (such as body shape, dress, interior design etc.) which
I lack completely and which bore me to no end.

<p>I am completely dumbfounded by the widespread societal disapproval
of homosexuality, and don't understand at all where it comes
from. As a male, every single male homosexual makes me happy: less competition

<H3><A name=sex>The Importance of Sex to Males</A></H3>

Most species exist as males and females and reproduce by
having sex. The reason is that
reproduction via
sex involves the random mixing of genetic material in every generation, which allows for
more variety, faster evolution and better adaption to a changing
environment. The young are born by the female, so the male is really
only needed to have sex and mix the genes. That's biologically the
only point of males.<p>

Now this is all quite abstract, but you can easily make it very
concrete: ask any male friend of yours what he would prefer, amputation of
both legs or amputation of the penis. So far, I have always received
the same answer. And usually the answer comes very quickly.<P>

Complete chemical castration, extinguishing all sexual thought and
desire, is a different matter though. I think if you paid me $1
million I would go for it. It would be a nice serene life.

The mere act of quickly and painlessly killing an animal is not a big
crime: it is not afraid of death, cannot anticipate death and
therefore has no reason to complain. Its friends and family have a
reason to complain, and that is the extent of the injustice. That
however is not what happens to animals in modern industrialized
husbandry. Many of them are separated right after birth from their
mothers, live out their lives in factory barns without
ever seeiing daylight, endure a long, frightening and stressful
transport and then a terrifying scene at a slaughterhouse. Being
killed is the best thing that ever happened to millions and millions
of creatures every day. No matter what system of ethics you subscribe
to: reducing unnecessary suffering is always one of the first rules.
The suffering of animals raised for food is patently unnecessary;
vegetarianism is the inescapable conclusion.

<H3><A name=teacher>Education Improved</A></H3>

Here are my ideas to improve school education and teacher
training:
<ul>
<li>Teachers should receive monetary bonuses based on performance. The performance
should be measured by objective criteria, such as number of pupils
passing a certain reading test, number of students going on to
college, etc. The size of the bonuses should be based on past performance
     of the school: in schools that send many pupils to college,
     teachers will receive a smaller bonus per college-bound pupil
     than in other schools.
<li>Pupils have absolutely no incentive to perform well in tests
     designed for international comparisons (e.g. PISA) or to compare schools/teachers. To change this, pupils
     should receive monetary rewards for good results on these tests.
<li>Teacher training should involve a substantial amount of hard-core
     subject studies; theoretical pedagogical studies can safely be eliminated. Classroom work
     is fundamentally practical, and it can only be learned by
     doing, and by observing others. Teacher trainees (and really all
     teachers) should be required to regularly observe the lessons of other teachers, and write
     reports about these lessons, including their positive and negative features. These reports should then be discussed within a group of teachers.

  character terminals or 286 DOS machines in the developing world, machines
  accessing the WWW through email, cellular phones, 12 million Minitel terminals
  in France, notepads like the PalmPC, even two-way pagers etc. Don't exclude
  users of these devices from reading your pages. In most cases, graphics are
  used on otherwise empty sites to hide their contentlessness; they almost never
  convey much useful information. Leave these gimmicks to the advertising suits
  and their muchly ignored corporate web pages.
  <LI>If you must use graphics and images, always include a meaningful
  "<CODE>ALT=</CODE>" description in the "<CODE>&lt;img&gt;</CODE>" tag.
  <LI>If you must use imagemaps, use the client-side type, because then even
  text-mode browsers have a chance of dealing with the links.
  <LI>If you must use colors, make sure that the page is still readable on
  black-and-white monitors.
  <LI>Use very few links on your pages. Every link will have to be pushed on the
  reader's mental stack to be processed later, and a growing stack makes them
  feel very uncomfortable. Also, the reader lives in constant fear that they
  might miss the best part unless they try out each and every link.
  <LI>If you include a link, make it very clear what resource it is that you
  link too. No one should have to "try out" a link. Don't waste people's time
  and money.
  <LI>Navigation should be trivial, content should be challenging.
  <LI>Use a <EM>very</EM> descriptive <CODE>&lt;title&gt;</CODE> for your
  documents. The title will be returned by search engines and will show up in
  people's hotlists.
  <LI>There are really enough "My favorite links" lists around. They belong in
  hotlists/bookmarks and not on homepages.
  <LI>Don't use the Netscape or Internet Explorer HTML extensions. Don't force
  people to use proprietary software if there are excellent free substitutes.
  <LI>If you believe there's money to be made on the WWW, forget it. The party

  the net are those who sell porn or who sell advice about how to make money off

<H3><A name=gnu>Free Software</A></H3>

Free software is now of an amazingly high
quality. Hardly any commercial text editor can compete with emacs. Gcc is one of
the best and most widely ported C and C++ compilers around. Linux supports more
hardware than any commercial Unix and is actively being ported to other
platforms, quickly becoming the most popular Unix. The GNU Hurd is the most
technically innovative modular and microkernel-based operating system on the
market while Microsoft, IBM and Apple only use these buzz words in their ads
without producing much that actually deserves the name. TeX is a typesetting
software that can be used to create extremely high quality technical documents
and is essentially the only choice for scientific typesetting. The Internet, by
and large, is run on free software: the web server apache, the email server
sendmail, and the DNS nameserver bind are all market leaders by wide margins in
their respective domains; in fact, the busiest web site (www.yahoo.com) and the
busiest FTP site (ftp.cdrom.com) on the Internet both run FreeBSD, a free
operating system. Google runs on Linux. Octave is a free replacement for the numerical software
matlab. The GIMP matches and surpasses photoshop's image manipulation
capabilities. The chess programs gnuchess and especially crafty win easily
against the vast majority of human players.<p>

(In an earlier version of this rant, I mentioned MuPAD, supposedly a free computer algebra system just as powerful as
Maple or Mathematica. It turns out that MuPAD, while gratis, was never truly free in
the liberty sense. The makers of MuPAD have recently
removed all gratis versions. This shows that we should
never settle for gratis software: it has to be free software that
gives you the source code and lets you modify it.)

<P>User support for free software is generally much more snappy
than that of commercial programs. Newsgroups, FAQs, WWW homepages, and even
personal email to the author are available on a regular basis. Usually bugs will
be fixed instantly. If not, the end user can try to fix them themselves, because
they always get the complete source code for the programs. Having the sources
liberates the user from being dependent on the program author.

<P>You don't read much about these achievements in the media. I suspect it's
because there's no advertising money to be expected from free software, so why
praise them? (One more argument against the financing of journals by advertising
here...) We should write more letters to the editors of computer magazines
asking why they refuse to include free software in their reviews.

<P>The successes of the free software movement suggest that one basic assumption
of capitalism, namely that quality can only be created if a profit motive is
involved, is wrong -- they forgot about enthusiastic volunteers creating a
culture where one's worth derives from what one gives and not from what one
owns. The neo-liberals love to repeat their lies: "You always get what you pay
for" or "There's no free lunch", never supporting them with any evidence. High
quality free software proves them wrong. GNU hackers of the world, unite!

<H3><A name=fiction>Fiction considered dangerous</A></H3>

We constantly have to guess what other people think or feel or how
they will react. This is relatively easy in everyday
life, but much more difficult (and important) in those rare and important
situations: you're falling in love, you want to break up, you want to apply for a new job,
you need to tell your kid that she has cancer, you need to console a
friend whose father has died etc.<p>

The only way we have to predict what others will think and feel and do are
stereotypes: simplified models of what people of a certain type
typically do in certain situations. Stereotypes aren't bad: they're
often the only thing we have. We usually use our stereotypes without
being aware of it: we call that "acting intuitively".<p>

But how do we acquire stereotypes? Many important situations are exceedingly
rare in real life. How often have you fallen in love? Maybe 10 times?
That is no data collection to write home about. But you have easily
seen a thousand fictional movie and TV scenes of someone
falling in love. That's where you got your stereotypes about how people
falling in love are supposed to behave. Your brain is not smart enough to distinguish between
those 10 real scenes and the 1,000 unreal ones: it's all mushed up
into one big stereotype. Those 1,000 unreal scenes were written by
authors who don't have any more experience with the matter than you
or me: they just made that stuff up. Your stereotypes about these central
matters of life are thus largely built on scenes that were made up by
people; there is no reason to believe that they resemble real
life. Your whole internal model of people is poisoned by
fiction. The more fiction you consume, the less you can trust your intuitions.

<H3><A name=black>Blackmailing Done Right</A></H3>

In general it is not difficult to blackmail an entity that has money, by
threatening to bomb, distribute poisons etc. They will usually pay
(they are insured after all), and you will get caught during the
handing over of the money.<p>

There is only one proper way to relieve them of their money: order
them to drop it out of a plane in small used bills over the
favelas of S�o Paulo.

<H3><A name=belief>The Strongest Beliefs</A></H3>

What are your strongest beliefs? Statements that you are completely
convinced about, that are beyond any doubt? Are there any such
statements at all?

<p>I'll work with the following definition: you are <em>completely
convinced</em> (CC) of a statement if you would agree to the following
bet: you will receive $10 if the statement is true, but you will be
slowly tortured to death if the statement is false. The bet will be
decided by a fair, sympathetic and all-knowing judge, no pettifoggeries.

<p>Here's a list of my CC statements:
<ul>
<li>"I exist." I find Descartes' Cogito ergo sum completely
convincing. Of course, "existence" is not to be taken in any material
sense; I would allow for the fact that I am an entity in a computer
simulation or in a dream.
<li>"2+2=4." This is of course using all the standard assumptions,
notations and definitions of ordinary arithmetic. 
<li>"The Christian story (of the God of Israel impregnating a virgin
to have their son Jesus die for our sins and rise to heaven) is false." To
me, this is exactly like the Flying Spaghetti Monster: an easy $10. I
want to know what the pope truly thinks about this, late at night when he is
alone. Is the Christian story CC for him?
</ul>

<p>Statements that, for me, don't rise to CC status:
<ul>
<li>"I am not dreaming right now." Have experienced too many lucid
dreams to ever be sure about that.
<li>Most mathematical theorems. It's too easy to overlook a subtlety
in a proof, especially when it comes to arguments that touch on set
theory, and I'm not certain at all that there isn't some widely known
theorem which is actually false.
<li>"The universe was not created by a good, omniscient and omnipotent God."
Though quite convinced, $10 is a bit meager here.
</ul>

<H3><A name=implants>The Case against Breast Implants</A></H3>

There are two
different situations in which the appearance of the female breast is important:
<UL>
  <LI>when the woman is clothed and looked at from a distance. Given the
  preferences of most men, small breasts are a disadvantage here.
  <LI>when having sex. The breast is visible and being touched; artificially
  looking and feeling breast implants are a clear disadvantage, while the size
  of natural breasts plays almost no role.
</UL>
From this it follows that for
women with small breasts the optimal strategy is not to buy breast implants, but
to wear "wonderbras" and other clothes which let the breasts appear larger in
scenario 1, while not lowering the odds in scenario 2.

<H3><A name=energy>Mass equals energy</A></H3>

Einstein's equation <i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i> is often illustrated
with a nuclear explosion: if you take the mass of the bomb before the
explosion, and the mass of all the remnants after the explosion, you
get a difference, that difference being exactly equivalent (via
Einstein's equation) to the
energy liberated by the explosion. But the equation is much more
fundamental than that: each time you burn some fuel to extract
mechanical or thermal energy, you also convert a tiny bit of mass into
energy. The mass of the remnants after the reaction is always a little
bit smaller than the mass before, the difference being exactly
equivalent to the energy liberated. Admittedly, the mass difference is
very small, but the point stands: you are converting mass into energy
each time you start your car or light a cigarette.<p>

I don't actually believe that we are "converting" mass into
energy. Instead: there is nothing but energy; "hard matter" doesn't
really exist. All the fundamental particles, electrons, quarks etc.,
are point particles and have no size. So how could they have mass?
They are really nothing but bundles of energy. The equation <i>E =
mc<sup>2</sup></i> does not give the amount of energy you can extract
from a given mass--it tells you the mass of a packet of energy. 
Of course, there are also packets of energy that don't have mass, e.g. photons.

<H3><A name=evo>Evolutionary Psychology is Crap</A></H3>

I was enamored with evolutionary psychology for a while. All sorts of
behaviors of males and females are so easy to explain if you
postulate that all behaviors ultimately aim to find the best
partner and to maximize the prospect of offspring. I'm now convinced that the field is completely
worthless. All they do is collect data and then come up with some
evolutionary story to explain the data after the fact. The thing is,
you can come up with such a story for virtually anything. Maybe some
other, better story could have explained the opposite outcome? If
evolutionary psychology were a science, then they would formulate
their hypotheses first, and then proceed to test them. Here are three
straightforward falsified predictions that follow from evolutionary thinking:

<ul>
 <LI>Males should encourage other males to become homosexuals (to
 decrease the number of competitors), and
 should be disgusted by and hostile towards female
 homosexuals. Females should encourage other females to become
 homosexuals, and should be disgusted by and hostile towards male
 homosexuals. Precisely the opposite is observed.
 <LI>The older an individual gets, the more they should be inclined to engage in
 dangerous and risky behaviors that could benefit their community or family; after
 all, they'll soon be dead anyway, so they may as well be of some help on their way
 out. This is observed in ants, but just the opposite is observed in
 humans.
 <LI>The richer people are, the more children they should have. The
 exact opposite is observed in virtually all societies.

<H3><A name=universe>The Kid who created our Universe</A></H3>

When looking at
the developments in physics and computer engineering over the last hundred years
and extrapolating for another 500 years or so, it seems pretty likely that
physicists will have a complete mathematical theory of all physical processes by
that time, and the computers will be powerful enough to run a simulation of a
whole universe based on these equations. Scientists will be extremely eager to
develop such an emulation in order to check their theories and to learn about
the effects of slightly altering the parameters. The age-old question "Is this
the only possible world?" could finally be answered.

<P>Such a simulation would be started at the big bang and would then proceed
with accelerated time. If the equations are correct and the simulation is good,
life will eventually appear, inside the computer's memory. A tremendously
exciting experiment, and more and more scientists will want to repeat it to
check out their own pet theories. Eventually, universe simulations will become
cheap enough to put them on every pupil's desk, for educational purposes.

<P>Of course, you already see where I'm going here. It is pretty likely that we
ourselves, right now, are sitting inside just such a simulation on some school
kid's desk. The remaining problem is how to contact the kid who created our
universe. Let's just hope that he didn't smoke anything.

<P><EM>Appendix:</EM> Let's quickly estimate the probability that we
are sitting inside such a simulated universe. In the worst case, a
computer that simulates a universe in real time takes up about as much
matter and energy as the simulated universe contains. In that case,
the total number of civilizations in all the simulated universes is of
about the same order of magnitude as the number of civilizations in
the real universe (since scientists will not stop before they have at
least one simulation running which is big enough to generate at least
one civilization, even if that means zoning off ever larger unused
portions of the real universe for their huge computers), and the
likelihood that we ourselves are simulated is therefore about
fifty-fifty. If it turns out to be possible to simulate a universe
with significantly less matter and energy than the simulated universe
contains, then the likelihood becomes much bigger. All this assumes
that the simulated universes look very much like the real universe,
but this need not be the case. After all, once we know everything
there is to know about our universe, "creative cosmology" will be one
of the few remaining sciences.

<P>Simulating universes creates a host of interesting ethical
questions.  Clearly, once there's life in your simulation, you are not
allowed anymore to switch it off permanently. However, temporary
interruptions are fine: the inhabitants of the simulated universe
wouldn't even notice. What if you see that there's needless suffering
in your simulated universe--are you allowed or even required to
intervene? God might have asked Himself this question from time to
time.

<H3><A name=future>The Future of Mankind</A></H3>

Clearly we will build truly intelligent machines eventually. These
won't be programmed in a logical way like chess computers; they will
be "self-booting" and will acquire their knowledge and intelligence by
learning, just like human toddlers. At one point these robots will get smarter
than humans, and they will then construct even smarter
machines. Stephen Hawking believes we might keep up by improving our
biology, tinkering with our
genome; to me it is clear that that won't work: tinkering with a
highly complex system that isn't fully understood is always more
difficult than building from scratch.<p>

The robots will either displace us (like we displaced the
Neanderthals), or they will keep us around (like we keep dogs
around). Maybe our best hope is to form a symbiosis of some sort with
the robots for a while (like the dogs do with us). It really doesn't
matter that much in the long run: they are the ones who will do stuff;
we will be onlookers at best. They will be the next evolutionary
step.<p>

You may not like that scenario; nervetheless, it will happen without
any doubt. I give it 150 years at most. Your
great-grandchildren will see it happen.

<H3><A name=end>End of the World in 10 Years</A></H3>
I have an idea for a novel. Here's the beginning: One day, people notice a novel white spot in the night sky. Astonomers train their telescopes on it, and after a while they realize that it is a large star, racing towards the solar system, having been expelled from its original location by a supernova explosion. A couple of months later, with the spot in the sky already noticeably bigger, NASA publishes its projections: with 99.9% probability, the star will hit and completely destroy the solar system in 10 years' time.  <p>

Actually, I'm not too interested in writing that novel. Instead, I want to know what would happen in the following ten years, how would people react? It's ultimately a question in mass psychology. Here are a couple of thoughts:
<ul>
<li>It's clear that there will be extreme inflation towards the end. Obviously nobody wants to sit on their money on the last day; instead people will spend their money like crazy. So, as time proceeds, money becomes less and less valuable while items that can be consumed immediately (food, drugs, sexual services) rise in value. The main question is: when does this inflation start, will it already be noticeable after a year or two? Does it make sense to convert most of your money into heroin and cocaine early on? Presumably, these drugs will dramatically rise in value, since people will want to have a good time towards the end.
<li>The reaction of the extremely rich people is interesting. These people are used to having things go their way; capitulation is not in their dictionary. How will they react? I can see three models:
<ul>
<li>Hire the world's best scientists and engineers, to find some way out. Maybe there's a way to construct a space craft that can escape the desaster, or a way to deflect the approaching star? But soon the scientists will come back with the answer: there's not enough energy in the solar system to divert the star, and there's not enough time to design and build a device that can escape the exploding solar system. (Maybe some scientists will "keep the hope alive" in order to continue to be fed by rich patrons.)
<li>Hire world class security and build an isolated fortress filled with food and amenities, so as to be able to enjoy the last ten years in peace. How to prevent that  the security guards later rebel and take over the fortress?
<li>Hire the world's top psychologists and economists to produce a prediction: how will people behave, and what's my best strategy to enjoy another peaceful and pleasurable ten years?
</ul>
<li>What about the legal system? Presumably people will be afraid that lawlessness will break out and that the world will sink into chaos over the last ten years. This has to be prevented at all cost, so I would expect that laws become draconian and penalties rise drastically. Once everybody has only one year left to live, even the death penalty isn't that big a deal anymore, so you need to start torturing offenders.
<li>Certain jobs require there to be a future, or else they are pointless. Examples are teachers, city planners, architects etc. In the last couple of years, these people will certainly lose their jobs. What should they do? Maybe learn another profession early on, or try to acquire a small farm somewhere to live off the land? The latter possibility implies that small farms will become extremely expensive towards the end.
<li>Surely many people will turn towards religions that promise an afterlife. Many new religions will arise, as charlatans attempt to profit from the situation.
</ul>

<H3><A name=math>All is Math</A></H3>

The best theories we have of the universe, Relativity Theory and
Quantum Field theories, are highly mathematical. Surely there's a
single theory underlying all natural phenomena, and it too is mathematical, and
maybe we are even capable of finding it eventually. <p>

Traditionally, we see these mathematical theories as
<em>descriptions</em> of reality: the mathematical entities stand in a
one-to-one correspondence with the entities of reality, and the theory
is such that the mathematical entities behave just like the
corresponding entities of reality. But what if there's only the
mathematical theory, no correspondence, no reality beyond the math? A consistent
mathematical theory whose solutions show an extremely rich behavior,
that's all, that's the universe.<p>

But mathematical theories are purely abstract, just ideas, you can't
touch them! How could they give rise to the hard stuff around me that
I can touch? Well, <em>you</em> may not be able to touch a
mathematical theory, but one feature of a theory can easily "touch"
another feature, once the concept of "touching" is properly defined in
the context of the theory.<p>

There are lots of consistent mathematical theories out there,
obviously. And I want to claim that they are all created equal. It's
not that some consistent theories describe reality while others are
just nice ideas: instead, each and every consistent mathematical theory gives
rise to its own universe of sorts, with most of these universes being
utterly boring.  Right now, as we speak, we are lucky enough to
experience the feeling of being part of the solution of an exquisitely
complicated, elegant and exciting mathematical theory.

Currently, the best available
astronomical data suggests that the universe is <EM>flat</EM>, meaning it
doesn't have any large scale curvature built in. While it is mathematically
possible that a flat universe could be spatially finite, most researcher
nowadays believe that the universe is in fact spatially infinite and contains
infinitely many stars (most of which we cannot see because light originating
from them hasn't had enough time to reach us).

<P>Infinite space with infinitely many stars. Wow. Consider the consequences:
the probability that a given star has a planet that can support life is
presumably pretty low, but if you have infinitely many stars, you also have
infinitely many stars with life-sustaining planets. The probability that a given
planet looks like the earth is admittedly extremely low, but if you have
infinitely many planets, you will have infinitely many planets that look like
the earth. The probability that on such an earth-like planet somebody hacks
together a cheesy web site containing weird opinions is certainly very very very
low, but if you have infinitely many such earth-like planets...

<H3><A name=freewill>Free Will</A></H3>

Science often overturns widely held and
intuitive beliefs. We believed to be important, the center of it all; yet now we
know to be nothing but mutated apes sitting in a corner of some
galaxy that is just one of many billion similar ones. Likewise, it is
fairly obvious that the Earth cannot be a sphere because then the people on
the other side would fall down, yet some strange scientists keep telling us
otherwise.

<p>A widely held and intuitive belief is that of free will. Being a
human involves constantly making decisions; it is obvious to us that we
could have decided otherwise, that we were free to do so, in fact that
we are free to behave in any way we like.

<p>I am convinced that this intuition is false. There is no room in
physical law for free will. There is, however, room for probabilistic
information processors, and that's precisely what we are. We take in
information, we have some other information stored, we have some
hard-wired goals and a reasoning apparatus, and using all that we make
decisions and act on those decisions. "Freedom" is the name for the
internal state of a probabilistic information processor while it is
processing information and coming to a decision. Our freedom is the
freedom of a chess computer before it has made its move.

<p>
Some people believe that doing away with free will is dangerous since
it also gets rid of all moral responsibility. Yet that is not true. A
chess computer that decides to make a move that turns out to be bad will be punished with a strong
refutation; if it is smart enough it will learn from this and won't make
the same mistake again. A probabilistic information processor who
knows that it will be held responsible for the consequences of its
decisions will tend to behave responsibly.

<H3><A name=religion>Religion</A></H3>

I reject Christianity mainly because of the character of the Christian
God. He forbade Adam and Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good
and Evil without any reason; I consider knowledge of good and evil
(ethics) to be a very worthy pursuit. God supposedly created us in His
image, yet He often gets upset with humans and engages in widespread
and indiscriminate punishment (Noah's flood, destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah, plagues of Egypt). This points to a certain self-hatred of
God. God often plays devious mind games on humans (Abraham and his
son; Job). He is extremely arrogant (when Job with perfect
justification complains about the injustice of his punishment, God
essentially replies "did you make the world, or did I?") and jealous
(he wants all humans to believe in him and only in him, the First
Commandment, but why would he care?). He is sloppy: after having won
the bet with the devil about Job, he returns the former riches to Job,
but neglects to resurrect Job's children and servants: he simply gives
him new ones.

<P>The messages of the old and the new testament are almost completely opposite.
The only admirable messages I can find in Christianity are the teachings of
Jesus: love everybody, especially your enemies, don't retaliate, don't judge,
live poor. Just like the prescriptions of Communism, these are
important ideals but unrealistic because they don't take human nature into
account.

<p>God claims to punish those who don't believe in Him, and reward
those who do. Even if I wanted to, I could not believe that there is a pink
elephant outside the door. I can <em>imagine</em> it, but I cannot
make myself truly believe it. My beliefs are simply not under my control. God punishing me for
my beliefs or disbeliefs is fundamentally unfair.

<P>Even the character and some of the teachings of Jesus are questionable. He urges his disciples
to drop everything and follow him, without any concern for
the welfare of the families left behind. At one
point he is hungry and gets angry at a nearby bush for not bearing any 
fruit. He then prays to God to destroy the bush as punishment,
claiming that everything a believer asks for in prayer will be
fulfilled. (He does not explain how contradictory requests of believers
are to be resolved.) He equates adulterers and divorcees, apparently wishing
to force people to stay in unhealthy and unhappy marriages for
life. He never speaks out against slavery or torture (nor does anybody
else in the bible).<P>

When meeting a self-proclaimed Christian, it is always a good idea to
ask "So, you must really look forward to your death, right?"  After
all, Christians believe that they will spend eternity in a blissful
union with Jesus, God and the angels. Beats taking out the trash,
doesn't it? Yet, strangely, Christians seem to cling to life just like anybody else.

<P>In general, someone who had to work hard to overcome many
obstacles deserves more respect than someone to whom everything was freely
given. By this measure, God does not deserve any respect: he never had
to overcome any difficulties whatsoever; he woke up one morning, found
himself to be all powerful and all knowing, and proceeded to create
the universe and mankind. Big deal. Furthermore, considering the natural disasters
and atrocities of history, it is clear that his creation was a piss
poor job.

<P>I reject Buddhism on three grounds: its fundamental premise "Life is
suffering" does not agree with everyday experience, the infantile
notion of reincarnation does not have a shred of evidence behind it,
and the concept of Karma was obviously invented to make people
behave. (There is however a benign and abstract reading of the reincarnation and
Karma doctrines that I agree with: everything we do, everything we
set in motion, every thought we put in other people's minds has consequences
beyond our lifetime; the matter making up our bodies is constantly
recycled to become part of other bodies.)<P>

I'm not sufficiently familiar with other religions to criticize
them in any meaningful way. In general I'm an atheist in the
sense that I strongly believe that no personal creator-god
exists. [I do however find the <a
href="universe">programmer-created-simulated-universe scenario</a>
quite likely.] I am also certain that no all-knowing,
all-powerful and all-good being exists: the tsunami put an end to that
notion.

<P>My own religion is a blend of some ideas from Spinoza, Buddha and
Teilhard de Chardin. For me it fulfills all the tasks of a religion: it
makes me feel good, it makes me behave, it provides a frame of reference.
The central idea is to deemphasize our individuality and
instead to consider ourselves as part of one big system, the universe:
<p>
<CENTER><strong><em>All is one.</em></strong></CENTER><p>

The old Greeks postulated atomism: the world is composed of
indivisible parts called atoms. Teilhard de Chardin provided an
important addition to this theory: there is only one atom; the
universe itself is indivisible. Whenever you try to separate one part of
the system from the rest, you inevitably make mistakes at the
boundary.<p>

One could regard the brain's neurons as individuals, but it is
much more fruitful to treat them as interacting and mutually dependent parts of
a whole. In a similar sense, I want to regard humans (and all other
intelligent beings) as the brain cells of the cosmos. It is
incorrect to say that human scientists are starting to understand the cosmos:
rather, the cosmos is becoming self-aware.

<P>Once one takes this perspective, one immediately feels a deep sympathy for
all beings and the whole system. The left hand may not feel the pain of the
right hand, but it will surely never hit the right hand and will help it along
whenever it can. Jealousy becomes impossible: no brain cell would ever complain
that some other brain cell found the answer first.

<P>One can even argue scientifically that human beings cannot be strictly
well-defined individuals: the set of atoms that make up your body is constantly
changing, and the matter that you are is different from the matter that you
were. Not even your thoughts are truly yours: they are influenced by countless
ideas of others you have read and heard. And from the viewpoint of
Quantum Mechanics, the history of the universe is nothing but the time
evolution of a single giant wave function subjet to Schr�dinger's equation;
that wave function encodes everything there is to know about the
universe, all in one single self-interacting entity.

<p>The truly big heart loves every single quark in the universe. Like the mystics,
I see all particles as vibrating, spinning and quivering with ecstasy.

<p>Our task (and the meaning of life) is to keep improving our institutions, knowledge and technology,
with the goal of approaching the remote logical end point of a good,
omniscient and omnipotent entity, akin to Teilhard de Chardin's omega point.

<H3><A name=thirdworld>Duties Toward People in Poor Countries</A></H3>

If you were lucky enough to be born into a rich country, your passport is by far the most
valuable thing you own. It shelters you from war, political unrest and
famine, and gives you access to a health care system, clean water and
air, decent infrastructure, education and job opportunities that with small effort
allow to live a life of luxury. Compared to the vast
majority of people in the world, you spend your whole life bedded in pink
cotton candy. You enjoy these privileges by virtue of your noble
birth alone, you didn't do anything to deserve them. It is a caste system on
a global scale: a moral outrage.<p>

The cockaigne is surrounded by fences and high walls, to keep out the poor and
downtrodden. Clearly you must help
people over these walls.<p>

There are a number of simple ways to do this. If you feel a need to marry,
you should always look for marriage partners in poor countries. As a
result of the marriage, your partner will get the opportunity to
obtain a valuable passport. Furthermore, if your partner is younger,
they will inherit your retirement benefits which would otherwise go to
waste.
<p>

However, marriage helps only one person. It is possible to help many
more, by assuming fatherhood of children of single mothers in poor
countries. Such declarations are accepted as valid by most countries
(unless the true father steps forward, an unlikely event) and the
children then get a right to your passport, ensuring a bright
future.<p>

Lastly, you can adopt children (or, in many jurisdictions even adults)
of poor countries who will then be able to receive your country's passport.<p>

It is your duty.

Don't take yourself too seriously. You aren't that important. In

replaced pretty soon.<p>

Whatever your job, chances are
that you do more harm than good. In one way or another, you are probably
contributing to the growth of consumption, to the widening of inequalities
between nations or people, or to increased demands in the world of work. Just
because someone pays you doesn't mean that your work is desirable from a global
perspective.<p>

<P>Try to leave as small a footprint as possible: sit still, think, don't buy stuff, save your
money, write a will benefiting some charity, don't procreate, prepare
yourself for death, retire early, kill yourself when the time is right. Thank you.

Death is no big deal really. Do you like to go to sleep at night?
Sleeping is nice, isn't it? Death simply means that you go to sleep
and you won't wake up anymore. I have no problem with that prospect
whatsoever.

<p>
Dying is a different matter though. Realistically, most of us face a
slow death in a nursing home, with slight dementia and various slow
growing cancers encroaching. Towards the end, you won't even be able
to tell where it hurts anymore.<p>

The only rational alternative is a well-planned suicide. This is a
perfectly noble way to die: the human being takes charge, makes a
decision, and acts. Unlike a leaf that floats in the air, passively tossed
around by the wind, until it finally falls to the ground.

<p>When you have
decided that the time is right, sell your belongings and give away
your money to charity. Then have your best friend organize your last
couple of weeks. This party is of course to be financed by credit
cards, consumer loans and loan sharks: the only way to permanently win
in life is to die in debt and without possessions.<p>

Planning ahead makes sense: life insurance policies will pay in case of
suicide if taken out at least two years before the event (in the
U.S. at least).<p>

The last party is going to be the best party of your life. Whatever you
fancy will be present: friends, women, drugs, food, music, tropical
setting etc. The idea is that all your life you can look forward to
those last couple of weeks.<p>

The exact manner of suicide is of course a matter of taste. I suggest
slowly increasing doses of heroin; each dose increase will cause a new
type of ecstasy. In the end you will die with a smile on your face: the last
moment of your life will have been the best one.

<H3><A name=monitor>The Ultimate Monitor</A></H3>

All current photos, monitors
and TV screens suffer from the same two problems: they do not display
three-dimensional scenarios and they do not let the viewer focus on arbitrary
things. Instead, the viewer has to focus on the screen itself and only those
things that were in focus when the picture was taken will appear sharp.
<P>That is primitive. A monitor should act exactly like a window, and this is
possible: every pixel on the screen should not simply be a light bulb that
shines light in all directions, but instead should be replaced by a whole sheaf
of individually addressable thin light beams which point in different
directions. These beams probably would have to be implemented as low power
lasers to prevent diffraction effects. A picture is then given by specifying a
light color and intensity for every addressable beam of every pixel sheaf.
Hopefully, the eye is easily fooled and not too many beams per sheaf are needed.

<P>To save energy (and computation power in the case of scenes that are
rendered on-the-fly), the display could track the viewers eyes and
switch on only
those light beams actually visible by the viewer.

<P>With a screen like that, the viewer will get a full three dimensional
impression (without any special glasses), will be able to move the head slightly

they choose. Just like looking through a window.

<h3><a name="freephone">Free Transmission of Telephone Messages</a></h3>
The 
telephone system offers essentially two ways to transmit messages, even 
internationally, without paying money: Requesting a collect call is free (dial 
0130-0222 inside Germany and 1800-COLLECT inside the US) and ringing the phone 
bell is free. If you request a collect call, the operator asks you for your 
name; this name will be transmitted to the other party for free (of course, the 
other party has to reject the collect call, otherwise it will get expensive). 
You can encode a short message in your first name. For this to work, you'll have 
to establish a catalog of first name - message correspondences in advance with 
the other party. You can also encode a message in the time of day you request 
the collect call, e.g. if you call in the first thirty minutes of an hour, 
everything is ok and they can reject the collect call, but if you call in the 
rest of the hour, something went wrong and they should accept the call. This is 
especially useful if you want to stay in touch while traveling. 
<p>In order to encode messages in the telephone ringing, you start again with a 
(rejected) collect call, and then you call the other party's number and let it 
ring a certain number of times, according to the message you want to transmit. 
The other party knows that they shouldn't pick up the phone immediately after a 
collect call but should count the rings instead. Again, a catalog of messages 
has to be established in advance.

<h3><a name="lenses">Lenses</a></h3>

Snail's eyes simply consist of a bunch of 
light-sensitive nerve cells without any lenses. Obviously, snails can only 
distinguish light and dark in different directions but they cannot make out any 
objects. 

<p>Our noses and ears are just as primitive as snail's eyes. It's all but 
impossible to make out the precise location and shape of the emitting object. 
What we need are portable odor lenses and sound lenses.

<h3><a name="zoom">Zoom Glasses</a></h3>

The one big defect of our eye is that it doesn't have a built-in zoom
feature. This needs to be rectified, and quick. Everybody wants it. We
need glasses that allow
zooming. How to do this without two large heavy lenses? I suppose we
can just use very high pixel camera and digital zoom.

<h3><a name="charger">Universal charger outlet</a></h3>

Pretty much everybody in the world has a cell phone, lots of people
have mp3-players and cameras. All these devices need to be charged, so
everybody needs to carry chargers for all these devices. In addition,
if you travel internationally, you need an adapter to deal with the
different outlet types.<p>

All this is ridiculous. We need an internationally standardized
low-voltage DC outlet that can be connected with a simple cable to all
these devices. No chargers anymore, just one cable.

<h3><a name="perpetuum">Perpetuum mobile</a></h3>

You've heard the physicists claim that a perpetuum mobile is
theoretically impossible. I believe they are wrong. All you need is a
nice strong rope. Simply tie our galaxy to some other galaxy
with the rope. Since the empty space in the universe is expanding but
the rope is not, the remote galaxy will
pull at the rope, thus performing mechanical work. This work can
easily be converted into electrical energy with a
generator. Voil&agrave;: free energy, courtesy of the universe. (To
make sure that we don't run out of rope, we'll just convert some of the
surplus energy into matter to make more rope.) If we tie enough
galaxies together like that, we should be able to generate enough
energy to avoid the entropy death predicted by the second law of
thermodynamics, since that law only applies to <i>closed</i> systems,
not to systems with an unlimited supply of energy.

<h3><a name="goggles">Video Goggles With Motion Detector</a></h3>

Video goggles are now sold everywhere: you can attach them to
your laptop, video iPod or DVD player and watch in privacy, on a
reasonably large virtual screen, while lying in bed, sitting in an
airplane, etc.<p>

It seems obvious that we need video goggles with a little motion sensor
built in (just like the iPhone). Then the laptop would know
when I move my head, and it could always display the proper portion
of my desktop, giving me a virtually infinite desktop. That would be
much better and cheaper than three LCD monitors standing side by side.
Even better would be a goggle that tracks eye movements, so one could
look at a huge screen without having to move the head.

<h3><a name="ventilator">Ventilator on Water Bottles</a></h3>

Wandering the ultra hot streets of New Delhi one day, I realized
that what's needed to cool off is a water spraying bottle with
ventilator. Since plastic water bottles are ubiquitous, all we need is
a fixture that's screwed on top of such a bottle, with a spraying
nozzle and ventilator, both mechanically operated by a handle. It
should also have a straw opening, so that one can still drink without having to remove the fixture. To keep
the turning ventilator blades away from the handle, it's probably best
to have the ventilar rotate in a plane parallel to the plane of handle
operation. <p>

Optionally one could attach the whole fixture to a fabric sack for
carrying the bottle, with attached
carrying straps. Occasional moistening of the fabric will then cool the bottle by evaporation.

<h3><a name="online">Legal Online Gambling</a></h3>

In most countries, online gambling is illegal. There is an obvious
huge demand though, especially in China and in the U.S.<p>

Option trading is basically gambling on future prices, and many use it
as a substitute for gambling. The problem is that right now, you can
only bet on tomorrow's price of a given stock or resource; for
gamblers, the time resolution needs to be much smaller to keep the
adrenaline flowing.<p>

So I propose option trading with much smaller time resolution. It
should be possible to bet on the price of gold ten minutes from
now, for instance. It's clearly legal, and it would satisfy most
gamblers. There's even a conceivable real-world use, for instance when
traders want to insure against price fluctuations while performing a
complicated transaction.

<h3><a name="artlang">Asian Artificial Language</a></h3>

The East Asian languages are fucked up because of their inane systems of
writing, with different symbols for each concept. For every concept,
one needs to learn two largely independent things: the pronunciation
of the word and the (stroke order of the) corresponding character(s). <p>

The phonetic system used in Western languages, once properly
implemented, is clearly superior: for every concept one needs to learn
only the pronunciation; the spelling can then largely be
deduced. Similarly, when reading an unfamiliar word, the pronunciation
of it can be deduced from its spelling.<p>

However, Asian languages are much more elegant than most other
languages in their almost complete avoidance of grammar. There is
really no need to distinguish between "I", "me", "mine", between
"give" and "gave", or between "dollar" and "dollars"; everything can
be unambiguously deduced from the context: "He yesterday give two
dollar I." All these grammatical rules one has to learn when studying
a language like German are pointless icing on the cake.<p>

I think we should combine the advantages of the phonetic spelling
system of Western languages and the lack of grammar of Asian languages
and create an artificial language with clean phonetic spelling and
Asian approach to grammar. This would then represent the simplest way
to communicate and could eventually become a second language for every
person in the world.

<h3><a name="placebo">Maximizing the Placebo Effect</a></h3>

Traditionally, western medicine treats the placebo effect as an
annoyance, something that is to be worked around in order to find the
truly effective treatments. Elaborate double blind studies are
designed to eliminate the placebo effect when studying drug effects.

<p>This is of course completely mistaken. The
goal of any treatment is to cure the disease, and if the placebo
effect can help, all the better. We need research about how to
<em>maximize</em> the placebo effect. Eastern practices and the
medicines of prescientific people will surely be helpful here, since
they often employ the placebo effect exclusively. Reassuring rituals,
encouraging speech, behavior modification suggestions, some
psychoanalysis etc. will all have to play a role.

<h3><a name="med">Global Medical Database</a></h3>

Anyone who has ever worked in a hospital knows that more often than
not, doctors don't know what's going on. They don't have a clear
diagnosis, try this treatment, and then the other one, and in the end
they hope that something works. Furthermore, every doctor has a couple
of favorite diseases and drugs that they keep falling back on. As they
get older, they gain some experience and forget some details of
rare diseases they learned in school. The whole system is extremely
unsatisfactory.<p>

We need a global medical database on the internet. If you enter the
characteristics of a patient and a
bunch of symptoms, it should give you the possible diagnoses, with
associated probabilities. It should suggest tests to distinguish
between those diagnoses. Then it should suggest drugs and treatments,
the cheapest and most effective for the current condition. Whenever a
doctor has administered a drug, they enter the symptoms, treatment and
outcome into the database, so that it can be updated in real time.  No
doctor can possibly have all this data in his head.<p>

The job of a doctor then changes drastically: their first duty is to
cleanly describe all relevant symptoms in a format the database
understands. Their second duty becomes to maximize the placebo effect,
as described above.

Every smartphone needs a universal electronic nose, a device that can detect the signature of the chemicals in the air.

<h3><a name="sat">Satiation index</a></h3>

The only way to lose weight is to consume fewer calories than you expend. The problem with this simple strategy is that you will experience highly unpleasant hunger feelings, and therefore few people can sustain it for long. I assume that different foods, even with the same calory content, differ in their tendency to produce these hunger feelings; in other words: they have a different ''satiation index''. Someone should come up with a validated and reproducible definition of such an index, and then it should be printed on all packaged foods, just like calory contents are today.

<h3><a name="mathdb">Database of Mathematics</a></h3>

Chemists have developed a nice system to uniquely refer to chemical compounds
(InChI) which makes it easy to query databases; biologists have
universally applied systems for naming species (Linnaeus), enzymes
(EC), protein structes (PDB) and genes (Gene Ontology). Nothing even
remotely comparable exists in mathematics.<p>

Mathematicians often redefine concepts with slight variations (for
example, the notions of 'ring', 'algebra' and 'compact space' do not
have universally accepted definitions). When reading a mathematical
article or book, one always has to check the particular conventions
used by the author. Worse, there are no databases that one could query
in order to find out whether a given statement has already been
proven.<p>

Mathematicians should get their act together and fix these
shortcomings. A formal language needs to be specified (which shouldn't
be a problem, given that mathematicians invented the concept of formal
language) and an extensible list of "contexts" should be provided
(e.g. G�del-Bernays set theory, first-order Peano arithmetic
etc.). Every newly defined concept must provide a context and receives
a unique identifier; the concept's definition can refer to the
identifiers of other concepts in the same context. Furthermore, every
concept definition may provide a list of suggested common names.  In
addition to definitions, the database should also be able to store
theorems, again with identifier and common name.<p>

Once a universally accepted formal notation and definition database
exists, journal editors could require all authors to refer to
these definition and theorem identifiers in their articles and submit
their new definitions and results to this database as a condition of
publication. <p>

It should be possible to query the database for any specific concept
or theorem, or for a list of known theorems connecting two or more
concepts. Ideally, the database frontend would incorporate some
limited proof intelligence, so that it could detect that a query
theorem is equivalent to a theorem in the database, or is a simple
consequence of combining several theorems in the database.<p>

In the long run, mathematical papers should be written in a
semi-formal language so that computers with access to the math
database can automatically check the correctness of all
proofs (similar to the <a href="http://www.mizar.org/">Mizar project</a>).

<h3><a name="facemask">Facemasks</a></h3>

A very useful low-tech device is a cloth facemask (similar to the ones worn
by surgeons when operating). In Japan, people are polite enough not to shake hands and to
wear a facemask whenever they have a cold. All societies should do the
same. It is the only way to reduce the incidence of colds and the flu,
two incurable viral diseases which have nothing to do with
cold temperatures. Many more people die from the flu than from Aids.

<h3><A name="locs">Locomotives with Water Cannons</A></h3>
In Germany, about 1000 people commit suicide every year by standing on a track in front of a running train. This often causes psychological trauma to the conductor; it also inconveniences many passengers because the train cannot continue and the track has to be shut down for a period of time. Obviously, everyone has a right to commit suicide, but not in this manner. 

The technological solution is obvious: equip locomotives with water cannons and shoot the suicidal people off the tracks. This might possibly be combined with radar sensors so as to automate the process.

<h3><a name="mesh">Mesh Network of Cell Phones</a></h3>

Most cell phone calls don't leave the city, and in pretty much every
city there's a person with a cell phone every couple of yards. In this
situation, cell towers aren't needed to transmit calls, and calls
should therefore be free. The phones should talk directly to each other,
establishing a mesh network (like the one-laptop-per-child machine
does), and calls should be routed through that network. <p>

For this to work, every cell phone needs to know approximately where
it is, so that calls can be forwarded in the right direction. But I
don't think GPS is necessary; regular cell tower triangulation should be
sufficient.<p>

Obviously not every cell phone owner has to participate in this mesh
network, but those who don't won't get the benefit of free calls.

<h3><a name="breakin">Breaking Into Computer Systems</a></h3>

To break into a company's computer system, one can proceed as follows:
buy a couple of USB sticks, load them with hidden self-booting
malicious bot software, and drop them in the company's parking
lot. Sooner or later, an employee will pick one up, plug it into their
computer, and the compromise is established.<p>

To break into private people's computers, the weakest link seems to be
the wireless router. These typically run outdated operating systems
that are never updated, and have an open port for administration. If
there's a tiny bug somewhere in the router's software, one can enter
the router via wifi. Once you own the router you have complete control of the
traffic flow to and from the connected computers.

<H3><A name=turing>Turing Test Improved</A></H3>

Alan Turing, in his 1950 paper
"Can a machine think?", proposes to rephrase the question as "Can a machine
simulate the input-output behavior of a human, as judged by a human?". This
latter question can readily be answered with the Turing Test: A human test
person and a computer both try to convince a human judge that they are human.
The judge, based solely on two separate fixed-length interactive conversations
with the contestants carried out over keyboard and monitor, announces at the end
of the conversations which contestant he believes to be human. A computer is
said to have passed the Turing Test if it is able to win about half of these
contests, with different randomly selected judges and test persons.
<P>I argue that the Turing Test is not very useful in practice, does not
properly capture "thinking capability", and Artificial Intelligence researchers
should not strive to build a computer that can pass it. This is due to the
following three objections:
<UL>
  <LI>The Turing Test does not properly measure thinking capability. It measures
  the ability to simulate humans, which is quite different. If aliens were ever
  to visit us on earth, they could not pass the Turing test, even though we most
  likely would ascribe thinking capability to them.
  <LI>The Turing Test is unfair towards non-humans, in particular towards
  computers. In order for a computer to be able to pass the Turing Test, it has
  to be taught a huge bag of otherwise rather useless information about what it
  is like to have a human body, because these topics can come up in Turing Test
  conversations.
  <LI>If a computer could be built that passes the Turing Test, it would not
  tell us anything new. In fact, the whole point of the Turing Test is that it
  would tell us exactly what every human around us already tells us every day.
  This computer would be utterly useless and easily replaceable by an online
  chat forum.
</UL>

I propose a replacement for the Turing test, henceforth to
be called the Boldt Test. The Boldt Test answers the question "Can a machine
produce as interesting an input-output behavior as a human, as judged by a
human". The setup is rather similar to the Turing test except that both
contestants try to produce an <EM>interesting</EM> conversation and the judge
decides at the end which conversation he considered to be more interesting. (The
conversation that he would prefer to continue is defined to be the more
interesting one.) A computer passes the Boldt Test if it is able to win about
half of these contests, with different judges and test persons.
<P>The above objections against the Turing Test are readily answered by the
Boldt Test:
<UL>
  <LI>While I don't claim that passing the Boldt Test completely and precisely
  captures what we mean if we say "thinking capability", I believe that it is
  much closer to the true concept than Turing's proposal.
  <LI>The advantage of humans in this contest is not clear: the foreign and
  alien perspective offered by a computer could very well be judged to be more
  interesting than everyday human-to-human conversation.
  <LI>A computer which passes the Boldt Test would be very useful because it
  would often produce new "interesting" perspectives and insights into all sorts
  of problems which we consider worthwhile. It certainly would be interesting to
  talk to, which is more than can be said about many humans.
</UL>

From a
research perspective, the Boldt Test is more fruitful than the Turing Test
because it does not present a dead end: once a computer passes the Turing Test,
it is impossible to improve it further since it is unreasonable to expect that a
computer could ever win substantially more than 50% of Turing contests. By
contrast, computers could easily surpass humans in Boldt Tests, at which point
they would start to compete against other computers or against aliens. In
addition, it is also possible to have two computers compete against each other
in a Boldt Test with a human judge even if they haven't yet surpassed humans in
thinking capability. This is impossible with the Turing test.

<h2><a name="random">Random Rants</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Restaurants should always show photos of their meals on the
menus. I want to know how much I get of the various trimmings, how they
are prepared etc. 
<li>Cafes and bars need to have comfy sofas and armchairs for their patrons. How in the
world do they think they can compete against the nice lazy chair in
front of the TV at home if all they offer is a bar stool? Is there
anybody in the world who likes to sit on a bar stool?
<li>This is the third millennium, and we still use plates and glasses
from materials that break easily when dropped. Obviously these
things should be made from plastics. 
<li>In Bangkok you can rent a Segway to dart around and explore the
city. All major cities need such a service.
<li>Another business idea: universal food delivery. One number you
call, and they will deliver food from any restaurant in
town. Obviously they negotiate favorable deals with the restaurants
ahead of time,
so that they don't need to charge for delivery. What's wrong with
this, why can I only order pizza and Chinese?
<li>When we spell out consonants, we prepend or append a syllable for easier
distinction. So we don't say "t" but "tee", not "f" but "eff", not "k"
but "kay" etc. Over the phone or when listening through a
loudspeaker, many consonants often
can't be distinguished. Was it "es" or "eff"? Was it "dee" or "tee"?
Was it "em" or "en"? <em>They attached the same syllables to different consonants!!!</em>
Obviously different consonants should get <em>different</em> syllables
attached to them, so that it's always clear which one was meant and
you don't need crap like "b as in bravo", "f as in foxtrot" etc.
<li>I stated above that I'm against the death penalty. One caveat is
in order. People who design fonts that don't distinguish between l, 1
and I, or between O and 0, should be shot on sight.
<li>When you're thirsty, your body tries to tell you that it needs
water. So let's have a look at a couple popular beverages: coffee,
tea, coke, beer. These are all diuretics, i.e. they stimulate urine
production. The body wants water, and you put stuff
in it that makes it lose water--how stupid is that? Coke, and often
also coffee and tea, contain sugar; coke also contains salt. Sugar and salt
make you thirsty. You're thirsty and you drink stuff that makes you
thirsty--how stupid is that? Fucking stupid. If your body wants
water, give it water. It's not exactly rocket science.
<li>"What you just said offends me!" That's a very cheap rhethorical trick, intended to shut up the opponent. The only allowable reply seems to be "I'm sorry, I didn't intend to offend you", followed by refraining from the offensive statement. I don't think the emotion of "being offended" really exists; if it did, it should never be used in lieu of a proper argument. The correct answer to the party claiming to be offended is "This piece of information does not contribute to our discussion" or more to the point "I don't care."
<li>It seems to me that one could use lots of tricks in soccer that
nobody has ever thought off. For instance: kick the ball in the air,
bow down and catch it on your neck, then balance it there and run
towards the goal. This could also be done while the balancer rides
pickaback on some other player, to avoid opponents. Or learn how to
run while balancing the ball on (or repeatedely kicking it with) your
forehead, again possibly while riding pickaback. Run on your hands and
squeeze the ball between your legs or balance it on your feet, etc. etc. 
<li>U.S. banks tell their customers that bank account numbers and
credit card numbers are sensitive information that should be kept
secret. But they print the account number openly on every check, and
they print the credit card number on the card that you have to hand
over with every purchase! If it's secret, KEEP IT SECRET! Man.
