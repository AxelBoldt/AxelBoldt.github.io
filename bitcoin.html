<h1>Why I Hate Bitcoin</h1>

<p>by Axel Boldt</p>

<h2>1. Wasteful</h2>

<ul>
<li>Uses about 0.5% of the entire world's electricity production, which is roughly the power of 15 constantly running nuclear reactors. <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index">[source]</a>
</ul>

<h2>2. Useless</h2>

<ul>
<li>Few legitimate merchants accept bitcoin.
<li>Not scalable: network maxes out at about 5
transactions per second.
<li>Transactions take a long time to be recorded in the blockchain; afterwards they cannot be retracted.
<li>There are many faster and cheaper ways to transfer
electronic funds internationally.
<li>A poor store of value: price is highly volatile and it is unknown whether Bitcoin will remain usable in times of crisis.
<li>Main use today: speculation. Minor use: crime.
</ul>

<h2>3. Insecure</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin exchanges keep the private keys of their
customers' bitcoin holdings. Several large bitcoin exchanges lost customers'
deposits after having been hacked. <a

<li>Wallets kept on personal computers are difficult to
secure. Because of zero-day exploits, wallets should be kept on "air-gapped" (offline) computers. You have to consider the risks of hardware failure, hacking, extortion
<a

death.
<li>You need to trust escrow services and/or companies that claim to store bitcoin securely.
</ul>

<h2>4. Enables crime</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin is the currency of choice on the dark web, to buy drugs,
counterfeit money, forged identification papers, child porn, stolen credit card
numbers, zero-day exploits etc.
<li>Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies are used in extortion
schemes called "ransomware", where the computer systems of companies,
hospitals, city governments and private individuals are disabled by hackers.
<li>Scam victims are directed to use Bitcoin ATMs (which allow to buy bitcoin with cash) to transfer money to the scammers.
<li>Numerous illegal "mixing services" and "coinjoin privacy wallets" exist to aid in laundering bitcoin: you
send in bitcoins and specify a return address; bitcoins from other participants will then be sent to that address. <a

<li>Tether, a centralized cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar, is often used to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. It is controlled by bitfinex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange. It claimed that it holds $1 in cash for every Tether mined, but later admitted that this was not true. In 2017, bitfinex drove up the Bitcoin price by buying Bitcoin with Tether. <a

<li>Price manipulation schemes that are illegal when applied to stocks are legal when applied to Bitcoin.
</ul>

<h2>5. Susceptible to centralization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Miners ultimately set the rules and will resist rule changes that aren't in their interest, e.g. replacing proof-of-work by proof-of-stake.
<li>Miner cartels may form. Once a cartel achieves a majority of mining power, it can change the rules in their favor or seek rent in other ways. This is known as a 51%-attack. Such a cartel could also start a double-spend attack and thereby create a final large windfall before destroying the network.
</ul>
