<H1>Predictions for 2040, made in 2004</H1>

The following are my predictions for the year 2040. They were made in
the year 2004 and have not been changed since (as you can check with
the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www-math.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/predictions.html">Internet Wayback Machine</a>).

<H2><A name=world>World politics</A></H2>

Russia and Morocco have joined the European Union. The EU slowly takes
on the character of a nation; it has a common foreign policy
and a standing army.<p>

The US remains the world's strongest power, militarily and
economically.
<p>

China has turned into a capitalistic authoritarian system, similar to
the Hong Kong or Singapore of 2004. Based on total GDP, it is among
the world's ten strongest countries, and growing. Taiwan has joined
Mainland China, and has received a long-term guarantee of independence
in return. The US see China as a strategic enemy, while relations
between the EU and China are good. Japan aligns itself more and more
with China. <p>

South-East Asia has joined the first world, and parts of South and Central
America are about to. Africa remains the world's poorhouse.<p>

The Arab-Israeli conflict continues.

The joblessness rate has reached 15%. To support the financing of the
social system and counter the low birthrate, Germany has instituted an
aggressive program to attract qualified foreign immigrants.

<H2><A name=IP>Intellectual property</A></H2>

The owners of music and movie copyrights vastly increased their legal
and technical measures to protect their content, causing a widespread
counter movement of "open source" media which may be
copied freely. Software to create music and movies is ubiquitous and cheap;
several magazines and tv shows exclusively promote open source music;
successful artists make money through advertising deals, live acts
and teaching.<p>

Wikipedia has grown into a respected resource. Linux, after
successfully fighting off several patent claims, has become the most
widely used operating system in the world.

<H2><A name=science>Science</A></H2>

A "theory of everything" combining quantum mechanics and general
relativity has been found; its mathematical elegance causes it to be
widely accepted, even though it has hardly been tested.
<p>
In mathematics, the Riemann conjecture has been proven, but the
Goldbach conjecture remains open. It was shown that the question
"P=NP?" is independent of the first-order Peano axioms of arithmetic.
<p>
An effective AIDS vaccine has been developed, and the WHO carried out
a world-wide vaccination campaign. There are almost no new AIDS
cases. Malaria remains the biggest killer. There is no clear "cancer
cure", just a plethora of different methods to treat the different
cancers.
<p>

DNA tests are a routine part of diagnosis, to determine the most
effective treatment for the patient based on his specific genome.
Many genetic conditions are routinely diagnosed in the womb and lead
to early abortions.
<p>
Transplantation of human organs are not performed anymore: spare
organs can be grown from scratch.

<p> Human cloning has become an accepted alternative to the ordinary
method of reproduction.

Oil has become too rare and expensive to be used in cars. Cars now run
on fuel cells; the fuel however is not hydrogen but a substance that can be transported and stored more easily. Fusion reactors produce a good part of the world's energy.
<p>

Computers regularly come with 3D displays and speech recognition; keyboards
are rarely used.
<p>

Several machines have passed the Turing Test, however these are not
traditionally programmed computers but robots that were raised almost like
humans. Robot psychology is an important new discipline. Robots start
to perform better than humans in various intellectual fields, such as
medicine and science. The extent of "robot rights" is a very
controversial topic. The world champion in Go is a machine. Machine
translation is as good as human translation.  <p>

Full body immersion units exist that allow people to explore virtual
worlds as if they were real. They are used for gaming and pornography.
There are also devices that directly stimulate the brain's pleasure center, and many drugs exist that improve various cognitive functions.

<p>
Tiny radio-controlled flying cameras are widely available; they have
been outlawed in many countries because of privacy concerns.
