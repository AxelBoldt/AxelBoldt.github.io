<h1>French Nuclear Tests in the South Pacific</h1>

The recent decision of the French government to resume nuclear testing
on the Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls in French Polynesia is wrong.<p>

I am in no position to estimate the possible ecological damage done by
these tests (and I'm afraid neither is the French government) and so I
oppose the tests on purely political grounds.<p>

The Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has recently been extended
indefinitely. The signing nations that not currently have nuclear
weapons agreed to never acquire them; the nuclear powers agreed in
exchange to reduce their arsenals and enter negotiations with the
ultimate goal of complete elimination of these weapons. In
addition, they agreed to provide the have-nots with the means to
peaceful use of nuclear power.<p>

The French action, shortly after signing the treaty, shows that France
sees the NTP as nothing but the cementation of the power of nuclear
countries. Nuclear tests in order to develop more powerful and/or
precise nuclear weapons are obviously not done in the spirit of
eliminating those very weapons. France wants to remain a nuclear power and
it doesn't want other nations to acquire the same status. This is
nauseating arrogance. It is also stupid, because it might well lead
many countries to the conclusion that ratification of the NPT does
nothing but belittling their own options.<p>

To be fair: China and the United States show the same arrogance and
stupidity. China has never stopped conducting nuclear tests and the US
stopped them only after having acquired the ability to conduct nuclear
bomb test simulations in a laboratory.<p>

But France has counted itself to the civilized countries up to now (albeit one 
engaged in <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/">state-sponsored terrorism</a> - never mind). This
and the fact that they conduct their tests not in their own country
but in a colony makes their action much worse.<p>

Strategically speaking: international protest won't change the
position of the French government -- they consider themselves to be a
world power after all. The resistance has to come from the French
people themselves. But how to induce this opposition? <em>Discuss the matter
with your French friends and don't buy French products.</em>
