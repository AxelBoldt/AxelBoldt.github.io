<H1>Ubiquity Script: Gcalc</H1>
<H2>by Axel Boldt</H2>

<b>Gcalc</b> is an <a
href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/">Ubiquity</a>
script that gives easy access to <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/calculator.html">Google's calculator</a>. It has all the features of a scientific calculator,
knows constants such as the speed of light or the mass of the Earth,
and can convert between units and currencies.<p>

You can check out the script here: <a
href="ubiquity_gcalc.js">ubiquity_gcalc.js</a>. If you have Ubiquity
installed, you should see a Subscribe button in the upper right;
alternatively you can get the javascript code from the above link,
paste it into your Ubiquity command-editor, and edit away.<p>

To use the calculator, invoke
Ubiquity (Ctrl-Space) and type gcalc followed by any mathematical
expression. The result appears immediately, you don't need to hit
Enter. Alternatively, highlight a mathematical expression with the
mouse and then invoke Ubiquity and gcalc.<p>

Also check out <a href="ubiquity.html">my other Ubiquity scripts</a>. They
are all in the public domain; you can use them in any way you like.
