<h2><a name="game">The Game</a></h2>

I believe the English name for the game is "the Shell Game"; in German
it's called "das Hütchenspiel". It is very simple: one actor has a table
in front of him with three little shells ("Hütchen"; they can be
anything from matchboxes to nutshells) and a little ball. He puts the
ball under one of the shells, then moves the shells around, stops and asks
the audience where the ball is. For a bet of about $30-$60, a player
can lift one shell. If he finds the ball, he wins an equal amount,
otherwise he loses the money.<p>

The game is played in all major European cities typically
in the areas with the
highest tourist concentration (for example: Rambla in Barcelona, Gran
Via in Madrid, Kurfürstendamm in Berlin, Bahnhofsviertel in Frankfurt
am Main). The actors are usually from
Eastern Europe. The game is classified as illegal gambling in most
countries and the actors are able to remove all traces of the game in
seconds when authorities approach.

<h2><a name="tricks">The Tricks</a></h2>

Several (usually two to four) members of the audience collaborate
with 
the actor. Once you know this, it is actually rather easy to spot
them: they look like people from Eastern Europe, they never leave the
game table, they play regularly (sometimes 
losing stupidly and sometimes winning), and they try to animate tourists to play as well.
<p>

The actor will always place the ball and move the shells in such a manner
that it is
obvious to all close observers where the ball is. He then touches all three
shells, as if to move them to their proper places (sometimes while
saying "is the ball here, here, or here?"). This is the crucial time
when the ball gets its final position: the first shell he touches is
always the one that everybody knows the ball to be under; he takes the
ball invisibly in his hand and moves it under the shell he touches
next. This is sometimes facilitated by the fact that the ball is soft
and can slide in and out of the hand while compressed. It's like
religion: you can only see it if you know it already.<p>

Then he asks the present tourists if they want to play. If one
bites, they have to hand over the money and then they
can lift a shell, invariably the wrong "obvious" one, and lose the
money. Most people get angry about their stupidity at this point
and play again,
sometimes losing up to five times in a row.<p>


If no tourist wants to play, one of the helpers plays in order to
animate the tourists. The helper will either lift a shell which is
"obviously" wrong and will lose his money, or he lifts the "obvious"
shell and wins. He wins because the actor touched all three shells again,
moving the ball back to the "obvious" shell.<p>

I have seen one variant of this scheme: sometimes the actor will not
move the ball away from its "obvious" position by touching the three
shells until a tourist has handed him the money.<p>

Occasionally, the first game will be played fairly for a lower amount, to
entice the tourist to risk more money. Cheating will start with the
following games. Sometimes repeat losers are kept in the gamee with an
ocasional win.<p>

Sometimes a helper of the actor will place a finger on the "obvious"
shell, as if to help the playing tourist and prevent any
irregularities. However, the actor will still touch the three shells,
the helper lifts the finger shortly at exactly the right time and the
ball again wanders to another shell invisibly. Or, as explained above,
the adjustment takes place after the money has been handed over.

<h2><a name="win">How to Win</a></h2>

It is very difficult; in general I don't recommend that you try
it. However, if you must:

<ul>
  <li>First of all, make sure that you know exactly who the helpers
  are. Sometimes one of them walks around several meters away from the
  table to watch out for police.
  <li>You can't win if you're alone. Even if you lift the right shell,
  they will come up with some reason not to pay. Bring at least two big
  friends. Prefer situations with few male helpers (they sometimes
  carry knifes).
  <li>You can only win once. If the actor senses that you understand
  the trick, he will immediately change his strategy and you can't win
  anymore. You can't continue to play at one of the nearby tables either.
  <li>Observe the game for a couple of rounds
       until a tourist arrives and loses. Be sure that
  you understand the actor's strategy fully and that you know where
  the ball is at all
  times. Don't give away that you know it though.
  <li>While you get your money out, keep an eye on the shells; sometimes
  the actor will "touch" them at this point once more.
  <li>Lift the right shell and tell me what happened.
</ul>
