Cahalan's definition of the trojan is not entirely true, either.

This has nothing to do with the definition of a trojan.  Take for
instance code that exhibits the above traits for a virus.  If said code
is designed to activate on a certain date and erase the entire volume on
which it resided, it would be considered a trojan horse (as is
Michelangelo).  Such details are irrelevant; the fact that the user is
executing code that is supposed to perform one task, and the trojan code
is sneaking in "trojan style" in order to be executed so that it may
perform its task, is what makes it inherent to the definition of a
trojan horse.
