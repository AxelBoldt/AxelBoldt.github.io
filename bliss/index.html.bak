<h1>Bliss, a Linux "virus"</h1>

Bliss has been called a virus for Linux, a common Unix trojan,
a virus-like trojan with worm-like
features etc, depending on whom you ask. Apparently, the definitions
aren't very clear. Here's its story.<p>

The first sighting on the <a
href="http://www.kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-security/">linux-security
mailing list</a> happened around January
31, 1997, and Alan Cox replied with <a href="alan_reply.txt">this message</a>.<p><p>


Then, on February 5th, the author of bliss, apparently a nice guy
concerned that <a
href="bliss_alpha.txt">an
earlier alpha version</a> of his code (which was posted on September 29,
1996 to comp.security.unix, alt.comp.virus and comp.os.linux.misc) could still be in use,
posted <a href="bliss.txt">version 0.4.0</a> to the widely read Usenet
newsgrooup comp.security.unix, complete with ample warnings and the prospect of a future
(GPL'ed?) source code release.<p>

It was promptly analyzed by <a href="alan_analysis.txt">Alan Cox</a>
on February 8th, and, one day later and much more comprehensively, by <a href="ray_analysis.txt">Ray
Lehtiniemi</a>. Quick summary: if you run bliss (which is, by the way,
not specific to Linux and can be compiled for SunOS, Solaris, and
OpenBSD) or any binary infected with bliss,
it tries to attach itself to (i.e.: infect)
all binaries that you have write access to, on all machines that you
have rsh access to. It writes a neat log of all its actions to /tmp/.bliss
and even has a <code>--bliss-uninfect-files-please</code> command line option that
sometimes might come handy, and actually does what it promises. Bliss
was compiled with helpful debugging information. I
especially like the
feature where it tries to patch the Linux kernel source, so that the next
kernel compilation will produce a much more cooperative Linux. Moral:
don't run it, especially if you're root. That's all there is to
it. We all knew already that we should never do anything but system
administration as root, now didn't we? We also should never run
executables that we haven't
compiled ourselves from inspected sources. Big deal. Enter McAfee.<p>

McAfee is a company that makes its money from the fact that people
continue to use inferior operating systems that can easily be infected
with viruses, with disastrous results. In their <a
href="mcafee_press.html">press release</a>,
dated February 5 and widely reprinted in clueless media everywhere,
they claim to have "discovered" bliss (actually, they are talking
about the earlier alpha version, but they don't know this), a program
that had been publicly available for several months
at that time, thereby proving that they don't even follow the security
and virus usenet newsgroups. They also recommend that you run one
of <em>their</em> binaries, without
letting you look at the sources, of course. Now what have we learned a
moment ago: is that a good idea? An <a
href="mcafee_analysis.txt">analysis</a> of the press announcement has
been provided by Russ Allbery. <a href="kai_message.txt">Another
message</a>
shows that the information about bliss was provided to McAfee by a
participant on the linux-security mailing list, where the sighting of
the alpha version had been posted previously. McAfee, the heroic virus discoverer!
Savior of the universe!<p>

Here's another <a href="trojan.txt">message</a> from Alan Cox about
the difference between viruses and trojan horses. Albert D. Cahalan
begs to <a href="trojan2.txt">differ</a>, but that is not the <a
href="trojan3.txt">last word on that matter</a>. And, on a final <a
href="parsons_note.txt">note</a>: bliss shows that Linux is popular
enough to attract virus writers, bliss makes people afraid of running
as root which they shouldn't do anyway, and bliss makes people
reluctant to
run programs without inspectable sources. All hail bliss!  <p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

For the paranoid: To check whether anything
on your system is infected by bliss, do <code>cat /tmp/.bliss</code>.
To protect against similar programs, keep backups of your important
programs in a safe place and use a program which detects any
modifications. Traditionally, tripwire has been used for this purpose,
but nowadays people recommend the free alternative <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html">AIDE</a>.

To read a description of a truly cool and diabolical trojan/virus as opposed to the
rather lame bliss, check <a
