   Given the choice between the right thing and the easy thing, people
   will tend to pick the easy thing, particularly when it comes to
   something like a computer.

   In a sick way, I'm somewhat pleased to see these reports, and not
   just because I'm making a living writing Linux antiviral products for
   McAfee; if the malicious fuckwits of the world think that Linux is
   popular enough to scribble graffiti over, that means it's actually
   making it in the non-hobbyist world.

   (And this is ANOTHER argument for something like the GGI; if you
   don't have to be root to run doom, it's just a little bit harder for
   an enterprising young virus to get in and fuck with the system.)
