                        <h3>MCAFEE DISCOVERS FIRST LINUX VIRUS; SHIPS
                        NEW VERSION OF VIRUSSCAN TO DETECT AND REMOVE
                        BLISS VIRUS</h3>
                        SANTA CLARA, CALIF. (February 5, 1997) --
                        McAfee (Nasdaq: MCAF), the world's leading
                        vendor of anti-virus software, today announced
                        that its virus researchers have discovered the
                        first computer virus capable of infecting the
                        Linux operating system. The Linux operating
                        system is a publicly supported freeware
                        variant of the Unix operating system that runs
                        on Intel-based personal computers.
                        <p>The virus, which is called Bliss, is
                        significant because many in the Unix
                        industry have previously believed that viruses
                        were not a concern to Unix operating system
                        users. Unix operating systems are typically
                        difficult to infect with viruses since a virus
                        writer must have administrative privileges to
                        infect a given Unix system. McAfee researchers
                        believe that one reason this virus has begun
                        to spread is because Linux users who are
                        playing computer games over the Internet, such
                        as DOOM, must play the game in the Linux's
                        administrator mode, which is called "root."
                        <p>"Bliss is a destructive virus which
                        overwrites Linux executables with its
                        own code," said Jimmy Kuo, McAfee's director
                        of anti-virus research. "Although several
                        incidents of Bliss infection have already been
                        reported, the virus is not currently
                        widespread. We encourage concerned Linux users
                        to download a free working evaluation copy of
                        our VirusScan for LINUX, which can be used to
                        detect the virus."
                        <h3>The History of Bliss</h3>
                        Very little is known about the history of the
                        Bliss virus. McAfee
                        discovered the Bliss virus two days ago, and
                        posted a solution Wednesday evening on its web
                        site. The virus is believed to have been
                        created as a research project several months
                        ago by an anonymous programmer, and until
                        recently was not an "in-the-wild"
                        threat. Recently, reports of the virus have
                        begun to surface within Linux Internet news
                        groups.
                        <h3>How Bliss Works</h3>
                        Bliss infects Linux executable files. Each
                        time Bliss is executed, it
                        overwrites two or more additional
                        files. Because the virus makes its presence
                        known by overwriting and destroying files each
                        time it executes, users are immediately
                        alerted to its presence. Bliss overwrites the
                        first 17,892 bytes of each affected file with
                        its own code. According to McAfee anti-virus
                        researchers, all files infected by Bliss are
                        irrecoverable.
                        Although the virus does not operate under
                        traditional operating systems
                        such as DOS, Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT,
                        NetWare and the Macintosh, files created in
                        these aforementioned operating system formats
                        and stored on Linux file servers are
                        vulnerable to corruption by Bliss.
                        <h3>McAfee Ships World's First Bliss Virus
                        Scanner</h3>
                        As a public service, McAfee has developed a
                        special update of its VirusScan
                        for LINUX software which provides an antidote
                        for the virus. The free working evaluation
                        version of the product can be downloaded from
                        McAfee's web site at www.mcafee.com.. McAfee
                        has also provided the virus sample to other
                        anti-virus vendors, so that they too can
                        develop solutions to protect their customers.
