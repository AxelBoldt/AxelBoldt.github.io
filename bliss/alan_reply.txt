Provide the actual binary itself with a warning to cert@cert.org. That way
people can inspect it to see if you aren't just a hoax. In theory you
can write a virus for any OS if the owner is dumb enough to install 
unchecked binaries as root.

You'll notice good distributions use signatures on their packages and
have verify facilities so you can check binaries are valid.
